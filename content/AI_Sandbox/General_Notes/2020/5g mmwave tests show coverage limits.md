# 5g mmwave tests show coverage limits

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

Carriers running limited mmWave trials reported steep signal drops behind walls and even foliage, showing that the super-fast spectrum lacks range ([Verizon 5G Trials](https://www.verizon.com/about/news/5g-mmwave-experiment-shows-limitations)). Deployment will require far more densification than originally promised.

## signal braid
- Carriers need small cells every few hundred feet, which increases capex drastically.
- The lack of range makes mmWave less useful for rural areas, contrasting with the global ambition of [[starlink public beta teases global broadband]].
- Indoor coverage still requires fallback to sub-6 GHz or Wi-Fi, which muddles the user experience.

## risk surface
- Builders may delay mmWave towers since costs outweigh the initial consumer base.
- Regulation on small cells may slow rollouts, especially in historic districts.
- Customers expecting near-fiber speeds may be disappointed when walls kill the signal.

## linkage anchor
This note sits beside [[nvidia ampere gpu reveal tightens datacenter race]] because both represent infrastructure leaps that require new deployments and huge capital.

## my take
MmWave feels like hype without a realistic deployment plan. The technology is powerful, but we still need lower-frequency coverage for most users.

## ending questions
How fast can regulators clear the small-cell backlogs so mmWave can match its promise?
