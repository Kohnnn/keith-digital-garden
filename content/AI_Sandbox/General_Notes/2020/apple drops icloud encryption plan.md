# apple drops icloud encryption plan

## scene cut
Reuters reported Apple dropped plans for iCloud backup encryption after FBI complaints ([source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive/exclusive-apple-dropped-plan-for-encrypting-backups-after-fbi-complained-sources-idUSKBN1ZK1CT)). The story underscored how policy pressure shapes product security.

## signal braid
- Privacy posture can be constrained by government leverage.
- Cloud security remains a policy negotiation space.
- User trust hinges on transparency, similar to [[Storj Removes Warrant Canary]].
- Security tradeoffs are rarely visible to users.

## single-line take
Security roadmaps are policy roadmaps once governments engage.

## link hop
This connects to [[Surveillance Normalized]] and [[NSO and the Entity List]] and [[Storj Removes Warrant Canary]].

## open loop
What privacy guarantees are sustainable under political pressure?
