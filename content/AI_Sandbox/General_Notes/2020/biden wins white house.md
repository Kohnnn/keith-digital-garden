# biden wins white house

## scene cut
The Associated Press called the election for Joe Biden, marking a shift in U.S. leadership and policy direction ([source](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-wins-white-house-ap-fd58df73aa677acb74fce2a69adb71f9)). The moment tested institutional legitimacy and transition stability.

## signal braid
- Policy tone changes ripple through alliances.
- Transition legitimacy shapes market confidence.
- The shift echoes governance resets like [[Queen Elizabeth II Dies]].
- Public trust becomes a macro variable.

## single-line take
Transitions are policy events as much as election events.

## link hop
This connects to [[Afghanistan Withdrawal]] and [[AUKUS and the Alliance Reset]] and [[Queen Elizabeth II Dies]].

## open loop
Which policy timelines change fastest after a leadership reset?
