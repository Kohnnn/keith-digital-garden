# ftc sues facebook for monopolization

## scene cut
The FTC sued Facebook for illegal monopolization, framing platform scale as a legal liability ([source](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization)). The action signaled a shift toward more aggressive antitrust posture.

## signal braid
- Antitrust pressure is now a default platform risk.
- Consolidation narratives face legal pushback.
- Policy scrutiny aligns with [[Platform Accountability Cluster]].
- Enforcement momentum builds slowly but persistently.

## single-line take
Scale has become a legal risk, not just a market advantage.

## link hop
This links to [[Platform Accountability Cluster]] and [[Trust in Platforms]] and [[Meta Lays Off 11000]].

## open loop
Which platform behaviors will regulators target next?
