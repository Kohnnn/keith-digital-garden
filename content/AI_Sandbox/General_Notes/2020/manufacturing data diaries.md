# manufacturing data diaries

Plants published digital diaries to track capacity and supply, similar to the logistics monitoring discussed in [[playbook covid supply shocks data review]].

## modules
- Real-time uptime data dovetailed with the remote work stories in [[remote work normalizes across platforms]].
- Visibility also matched the zero slack insight from [[slack is a luxury in supply chains]].

## my take
I now expect industrial data to be open, not siloed.

## linkage

## ending questions
How much data transparency does manufacturing need for resilience?
