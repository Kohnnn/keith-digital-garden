# oppose the earn it act

## scene cut
Mozilla's campaign argued the EARN IT Act would undermine encryption and privacy protections ([source](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/oppose-earn-it-act/)). It positioned the bill as a policy lever on security tooling.

## signal braid
- Encryption policy debates now target platforms directly.
- Legislative language can reshape technical defaults.
- The risk mirrors [[apple drops icloud encryption plan]].
- Privacy posture becomes a compliance question.

## single-line take
Encryption is increasingly negotiated in legislation, not just engineering.

## link hop
This links to [[apple drops icloud encryption plan]] and [[Surveillance Normalized]] and [[NSO and the Entity List]].

## open loop
Which technical safeguards can survive shifting policy rules?
