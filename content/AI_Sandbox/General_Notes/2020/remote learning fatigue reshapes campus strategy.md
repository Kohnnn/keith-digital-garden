# remote learning fatigue reshapes campus strategy

Universities admitted that Zoom fatigue is real and started planning hybrid campus experiences, echoing the logistics resilience idea from [[slack is a luxury in supply chains]].

## signal braid
- The pivot links to remote infrastructure from [[remote work normalizes across platforms]].
- Highlights human sustainability concerns referenced in [[climate anxiety pushes infra teams into scenario planning]].

## my take
Physical campuses aren’t dead, but planning must include digital rituals now.

## ending questions
Will universities keep hybrid options once fatigue subsides?
