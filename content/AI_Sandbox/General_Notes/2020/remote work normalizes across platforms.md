# remote work normalizes across platforms

Twitter, Square, and Shopify told their workforces to work from home permanently, and that narrative shifted the conversation toward computing-as-a-service ([Twitter Work From Home](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/updates-on-covid19.html)). The sudden mass adoption highlighted how little slack existed in collaboration infrastructure.

## signal braid
- Office tenants immediately saw demand evaporate, confirming that real estate felt vulnerable.
- Companies that had never run distributed teams scrambled for asynchronous rituals.
- Demand for Zoom, Slack, and other remote-first tools spiked, creating a new baseline for usage.
- The move fed straight into [[zoom security meltdown exposes cryptography gaps]]; trust now mattered more than features.

## risk surface
- Burnout risks rose because boundaries between home and office blurred.
- Companies without mature remote practices risked productivity collapses.
- Security posture suffered when VPNs were overloaded.

## linkage anchor
Remote-first decisions now thread through [[social cooling]] because behaviour shifts rapidly with surveillance proxies, and they also link to [[zoom closes account after tiananmen event]] since geopolitics affects infrastructure choices.

## my take
Work from anywhere is doable, but culture becomes the hard part. The companies that treat remote work as a steady state will win the talent market.

## ending questions
When will leaders stop treating remote work as an emergency and start funding it like a product?
