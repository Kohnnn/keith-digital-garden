# ruth bader ginsburg dies

## scene cut
NPR reported the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a pivotal figure in U.S. law and culture ([source](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/18/100306972/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-champion-of-gender-equality-dies-at-87)). The moment intensified focus on judicial succession and legacy.

## signal braid
- Leadership transitions shift institutional direction.
- Court composition has long-term policy gravity.
- The transition echo matches [[Supreme Court Overturns Roe v Wade]].
- Legitimacy depends on process and timing.

## link hop
This connects to [[Supreme Court Overturns Roe v Wade]] and [[Queen Elizabeth II Dies]] and [[US Senate Votes Daylight Saving Permanent]].
