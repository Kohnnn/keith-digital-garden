# social cooling

## scene cut
Social Cooling described how data scoring can subtly suppress behavior and autonomy ([source](https://www.socialcooling.com/)). The idea reframed surveillance as a behavioral incentive system.

## signal braid
- Scoring systems shape behavior without explicit bans.
- Privacy erosion can feel like self-censorship.
- The dynamic aligns with [[Surveillance Normalized]].
- Trust collapses when incentives are hidden.
- Sanctions against anonymity tools like [[tornado cash sanctions redraw crypto privacy lines]] show how the incentives now have legal teeth.

## single-line take
Behavior changes fastest when the scoring rules are invisible.

## link hop
This links to [[Surveillance Normalized]], [[NSO and the Entity List]], [[Trust in Platforms]], and [[tornado cash sanctions redraw crypto privacy lines]].

## open loop
Which scoring systems are already shaping daily choices?
