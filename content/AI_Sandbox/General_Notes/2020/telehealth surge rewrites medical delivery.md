# telehealth surge rewrites medical delivery

CMS relaxed HIPAA enforcement and allowed audio-only visits, and telehealth claims spiked 154% in March over the previous year ([CMS Telehealth Data](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-expands-telehealth-services-coverage-and-payments-during-coronavirus-public-health-emergency)). Clinicians and patients both discovered that digital visits work.

## scene cut
Hospitals repurposed call centers into teletriage hubs and started shipping tablets to seniors. Primary-care physicians had to learn video etiquette overnight.

## signal braid
- HIPAA waivers decreased friction, showing how regulation can enable digital transitions faster than product teams.
- Telehealth also mirrors the remote work surge in [[remote work normalizes across platforms]] because both rely on rethinking presence.
- Payment parity discussions show how insurers (public and private) now treat virtual care as legitimate.

## risk surface
- Quality control becomes tricky when physical exams are replaced by video.
- Security posture is relaxed during the crisis, but a breach could have long-lasting effects.
- Telehealth companies now compete for patients and providers simultaneously.

## linkage anchor
This surge intersects with [[apple google contact tracing framework]] because both emphasize digital-first health data and also connect to [[ppe supply chain scramble]] since supply and demand both had to be rerouted.

## my take
Telehealth proved that medicine can scale digitally, but we still need standardized ways to triage and reimburse virtual care long-term.

## ending questions
Which aspects of telehealth should stay digital even after the emergency ends?
