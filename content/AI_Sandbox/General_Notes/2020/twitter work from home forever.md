# twitter work from home forever

## scene cut
Twitter announced employees could work from home indefinitely, turning a crisis policy into a permanent option ([source](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/twitter-will-allow-employees-to-work-at-home-forever)). The move defined early norms for remote-first tech.

## signal braid
- Remote work became a competitive talent lever.
- Culture and collaboration shifted into tooling space.
- The decision foreshadows [[Remote Work Normalizes]].
- Policy changes become retention strategies.

## single-line take
Remote policy moves are labor market moves.

## link hop
This links to [[Remote Work Normalizes]] and [[Labor Shortage and the Quit Wave]] and [[Work Without a Center]].

## open loop
What work rituals become mandatory when location is optional?

## updates
- 2025-02-27: Seed draft from 2020 backfill. Pending manual review.
