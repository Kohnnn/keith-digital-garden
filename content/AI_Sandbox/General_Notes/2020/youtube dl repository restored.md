# youtube dl repository restored

## scene cut
GitHub restored the youtube-dl repository and explained its stance on DMCA requests ([source](https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/)). The reversal showed platform policy can flex under public scrutiny.

## signal braid
- Public pressure can influence enforcement outcomes.
- Platform governance includes transparency moments.
- Community trust rebounds when reversals are explained.
- The backstory sits next to [[youtube-dl dmca takedown]].

## single-line take
Reversals matter because they show where policy is still negotiable.

## link hop
This connects to [[youtube-dl dmca takedown]] and [[Trust in Platforms]] and [[Platform Accountability Cluster]].

## open loop
What standard of evidence should platforms require before takedowns?
