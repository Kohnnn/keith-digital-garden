# zoom closes account after tiananmen event

## scene cut
Axios reported Zoom closed an account tied to a Tiananmen event, raising questions about cross-border policy pressure ([source](https://www.axios.com/zoom-closes-chinese-user-account-tiananmen-square-f218fed1-69af-4bdd-aac4-7eaf67f34084.html)). The incident framed platform compliance as a geopolitical issue.

## signal braid
- Platforms face conflicting jurisdiction demands.
- Access policies can become diplomatic flashpoints.
- Enforcement volatility echoes [[Twitter Suspends Paul Graham Account]].
- Trust depends on consistent governance.

## single-line take
Global platforms are forced to pick which rules they obey.

## link hop
This links to [[Twitter Accepts Musk Offer]] and [[Platform Accountability Cluster]] and [[Trust in Platforms]].

## open loop
What governance model can survive incompatible legal regimes?

## updates
