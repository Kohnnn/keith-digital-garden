# China's Power Crunch

The power shortages in China were a reminder that energy is the real operating system of the economy. Factories shut down, provinces rationed power, and supply chains felt the drag. The story was not just about a fuel price spike. It was about how tight the system had become.

I read it as an energy policy stress test. When electricity supply is constrained, industrial output becomes a function of policy, not just demand. That means energy policy becomes a form of industrial policy. <span class="inline-claim">When power is tight, growth becomes rationed</span>.

The shortage also pushed coal demand higher, which exposed a contradiction: decarbonization goals versus near-term stability. That tension will keep repeating whenever energy markets tighten.

## signals
- Energy constraints can ripple into global supply chains quickly.
- Policy decisions can ration growth by rationing power.
- Coal demand remains a fallback even under climate goals.
- Price shocks in energy transmit into inflation risk.
- Industrial output is now more sensitive to energy governance.

## my take
This was a preview of a volatile energy decade. Transition goals are real, but the system still depends on legacy fuels. Any mismatch creates rationing and price spikes. That reality will shape commodities, industrial planning, and geopolitical leverage.

I keep this near [[Inflation Prints 6.8]] because energy price shocks are a direct path into inflation. It also sits near [[Chip Shortage and the Hardware Bottleneck]] because power constraints and hardware constraints often show up together in supply chains.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Constraint:</strong> Electricity is the first bottleneck.</li>
  <li><strong>Policy:</strong> Rationing becomes a quiet form of control.</li>
  <li><strong>Transition:</strong> Stability still leans on legacy fuel.</li>
  <li><strong>Shock:</strong> Energy prices leak into everything.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Power stress is a macro signal, not a niche one.</li>
</ul>
