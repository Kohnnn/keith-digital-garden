# India Oxygen Crisis

<div class="keyword-row">
  <span class="inline-keyword">oxygen</span>

</div>

The oxygen shortage in India during the surge was a visible system failure. Hospitals ran short, patients waited, and supply became the bottleneck between care and loss. The crisis was immediate and deeply human.

I read it as a supply chain failure in health infrastructure. When a basic resource becomes scarce, the entire system collapses. <span class="inline-claim">Health systems are only as strong as their simplest supply lines</span>.

The policy response included emergency logistics and international aid, but the structural gaps were already exposed. That exposure will shape future health planning.

## signals
- Critical supplies can become the primary constraint in crises.
- Emergency logistics is part of healthcare capacity.
- Policy readiness depends on supply visibility.
- Public trust erodes when basic care is unavailable.
- Health shocks have immediate economic spillovers.

## my take
This crisis showed that resilience is built in advance, not in the moment. If oxygen can become scarce, so can any other essential resource.

I keep this linked to [[Delta Wave and the Global Reset]] because variant surges reveal system weaknesses fastest.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Supply:</strong> The simplest inputs become the hardest constraints.</li>
  <li><strong>Planning:</strong> Capacity without logistics is false capacity.</li>
  <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Public faith depends on basic availability.</li>
  <li><strong>Policy:</strong> Preparedness is a supply chain problem.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Health shocks spill into the economy.</li>
</ul>
