# Labor Shortage and the Quit Wave

<div class="keyword-row">
  <span class="inline-keyword">labor</span>

The quit wave turned labor markets into a bargaining arena. Businesses struggled to hire, wage pressure rose, and workers showed a new willingness to walk. The story was not just about scarcity; it was about leverage.

I read it as a trust shift. People re-evaluated work after the pandemic shock, and that reshaped expectations around pay, flexibility, and safety. <span class="inline-claim">Labor markets are confidence markets</span>.

The economic effect was visible in wage inflation and service bottlenecks. That fed into broader inflation narratives.

## signals
- Hiring friction rose across service sectors.
- Wage pressure became a visible inflation channel.
- Flexibility and safety became compensation issues.
- Labor supply responded to trust as much as pay.
- Hiring delays translated into service delays.

## my take
This was not just a labor shortage; it was a bargaining reset. Employers now compete on trust and stability, not just wages.

I keep this linked to [[Inflation Prints 6.8]] because wage pressure feeds macro pricing.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Leverage:</strong> Workers gained bargaining power.</li>
  <li><strong>Pay:</strong> Wages moved faster than planning models.</li>
  <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Safety and flexibility became core demands.</li>
  <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Wage pressure feeds price pressure.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Labor is a macro indicator now.</li>
</ul>
