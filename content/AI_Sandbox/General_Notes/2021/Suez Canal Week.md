# Suez Canal Week

The Suez blockage felt small and huge at the same time. One ship turned sideways and the global supply chain held its breath. The story was funny on the surface, but the underlying message was serious: the system is efficient, not resilient.

I read the week as a lesson in choke points. The world economy routes through a handful of narrow corridors. Most of the time that is invisible. When one corridor closes, you suddenly see how much of the system depends on a few miles of water.

It also showed how fast logistics becomes culture. Social feeds were full of memes, but the real cost was in delays, insurance claims, and rerouted schedules. The public saw a spectacle. Operators saw a risk model they had underestimated. <span class="inline-claim">Single points of failure hide in plain sight</span>.

## signals
- Global logistics is optimized for speed, not slack.
- Choke points carry disproportionate systemic risk.
- The public notices supply chains only when they break.
- Delay costs ripple long after the headline disappears.
- Resilience is a capital decision, not a moral one.

## my take
This was a useful reminder that infrastructure is the quiet backbone of everything else. It also made me think about how we plan for shocks. If a single event can jam the system, the question is not whether it will happen again, but how often. The system will not make itself resilient without incentives.

I keep this linked to [[Chip Shortage and the Hardware Bottleneck]] because both are about hidden constraints surfacing in plain view. One is water, the other is silicon, but the lesson is identical.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Fragility:</strong> Efficiency hides fragility until a break happens.</li>
  <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> The public learns logistics through disruption.</li>
  <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Delays are a tax on every downstream decision.</li>
  <li><strong>Design:</strong> Resilience requires up-front investment.</li>
  <li><strong>Memory:</strong> Systems forget risk faster than they should.</li>
</ul>
