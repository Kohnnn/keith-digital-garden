The Texas freeze turned power infrastructure into a public crisis. As the storm hit, generation failed, homes lost heat, and the state faced cascading outages. The immediate story was weather, but the deeper story was system design.

I read it as a resilience failure. The system was optimized for cost and normal conditions, not for extreme events. When rare conditions arrived, there was no buffer. <span class="inline-claim">Reliability is paid for in advance</span>.

The event also exposed policy choices. Grid isolation, market rules, and winterization standards all became part of the postmortem. That turns infrastructure into governance.

## signals
- Weather extremes expose system design choices.
- Reliability requires investment before the crisis.
- Market incentives can underfund resilience.
- Grid isolation limits emergency support.
- Policy after the fact is more expensive than prevention.

## my take
This was a warning about climate volatility. The grid will be tested more often, and the cost of ignoring extremes will keep rising. The real work is building redundancy before the next event arrives.

I keep this linked to [[China's Power Crunch]] because both show how energy constraints ripple into economic life.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Design:</strong> Systems fail at their weakest assumptions.</li>
  <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Resilience is cheaper than recovery.</li>
  <li><strong>Policy:</strong> Infrastructure is a governance choice.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Extremes are now more frequent.</li>
  <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Outages reset public confidence.</li>
</ul>
