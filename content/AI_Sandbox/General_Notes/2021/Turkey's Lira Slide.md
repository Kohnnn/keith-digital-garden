# Turkey's Lira Slide

<div class="keyword-row">
  <span class="inline-keyword">inflation</span>

The lira slide turned policy debate into a real-time market event. Rate cuts into rising inflation eroded credibility, and the currency took the signal literally. The shock was not just the number, it was the speed.

I read it as a confidence collapse. Currency value is a vote on policy coherence. When that vote turns negative, the spiral is hard to stop without a sharp change in direction. <span class="inline-claim">Markets can forgive mistakes, but not mixed signals</span>.

The economic impact landed on households fast. Inflation is not abstract when imported goods spike and savings lose value. That is why the social response matters as much as the central bank response.

## signals
- Policy credibility is a currency stabilizer.
- Inflation expectations can outpace official targets quickly.
- Market confidence can break faster than it can be rebuilt.
- Household pain is the political constraint on monetary policy.
- Currency weakness feeds back into inflation.

## my take
This was a textbook case of policy credibility being priced in real time. The longer the messaging stayed inconsistent, the more the market punished it. The path back is always harder than the slide down.

I keep this linked to [[Inflation Prints 6.8]] because both show how inflation narratives shape behavior.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Rates are only half of policy; credibility is the other half.</li>
  <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Currency moves are faster than politics.</li>
  <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Inflation lands first on daily life.</li>
  <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Confidence is expensive to rebuild.</li>
  <li><strong>Cycle:</strong> Weak currency fuels higher prices.</li>
</ul>
