<div class="keyword-row">

The reopening of U.S. travel to vaccinated visitors reset timelines for airlines, tourism, and cross-border business. It was a practical policy step, but it also carried symbolic weight: an admission that reopening requires managed risk.

I read it as a demand unlock. Once borders open, pent-up travel demand shows up quickly, but capacity does not. <span class="inline-claim">Reopenings create demand shocks as much as relief</span>.

The other signal is policy sequencing. Travel rules become templates for other reopening policies, shaping how countries coordinate.

## signals
- Reopening triggers demand faster than capacity can expand.
- Travel rules shape broader policy expectations.
- Tourism recovery depends on predictable policy windows.
- Airlines plan around regulatory stability, not just demand.
- Cross-border business relies on clear health rules.

## my take
This step showed that reopening is a negotiated process, not a switch. The winners will be the systems that can scale capacity quickly without losing safety.

I keep this linked to [[Omicron and the Risk Reset]] because policy reversals remain the core risk.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Demand:</strong> Borders opening releases delayed travel quickly.</li>
  <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Airlines need stability to scale.</li>
  <li><strong>Policy:</strong> Travel rules define risk tolerance.</li>
  <li><strong>Tourism:</strong> Recovery depends on predictability.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Reopening is a managed risk, not a clean reset.</li>
</ul>
