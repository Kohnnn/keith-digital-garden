# Vaccine Inequality and the Gap

<div class="keyword-row">
  <span class="inline-keyword">vaccines</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">equity</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">policy</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">trust</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">supply</span>
</div>

The vaccine rollout gap made the pandemic a two-speed world. Some countries debated boosters while others struggled to secure first doses. That imbalance became a policy problem and a moral one.

I read it as a trust risk. When access is uneven, global cooperation weakens and skepticism grows. <span class="inline-claim">Equity is a control measure, not just a value</span>.

The supply constraint also mattered for variants. Uneven vaccination creates more room for mutation, which feeds back into global risk.

## signals
- Access gaps turned into policy friction.
- Equity affects global trust and cooperation.
- Supply constraints can prolong variant risk.
- Booster debates widened political tension.
- Health policy became geopolitical.

## my take
This was a reminder that global health is system health. Uneven protection is not just unfair; it is destabilizing.

I keep this linked to [[Delta Wave and the Global Reset]] because inequality feeds variant risk.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Access:</strong> Uneven rollout prolongs instability.</li>
  <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Inequality weakens cooperation.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Variants thrive in gaps.</li>
  <li><strong>Policy:</strong> Health policy is now geopolitical.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Supply is a strategic asset.</li>
</ul>
