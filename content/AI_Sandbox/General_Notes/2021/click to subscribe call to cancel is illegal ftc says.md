# “click to subscribe, call to cancel” is illegal, ftc says

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

“Click to subscribe, call to cancel” is illegal, FTC says surfaced as a high-signal public thread and points to a broader shift in how builders respond to the current cycle ([source](https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/11/the-end-of-click-to-subscribe-call-to-cancel-one-of-the-news-industrys-favorite-retention-tactics-is-illegal-ftc-says/)). I see it as a hinge between immediate outcomes and longer-term incentives. The headline is not just the event but the behavior it reveals.

## context + claim
The story puts a spotlight on “click to subscribe, call to cancel” is illegal, ftc says, which matters because it reframes where teams allocate attention. My claim: this is less about a single win and more about how the stack and the market are rebalancing around trust and durability.

## causal chain
Signal -> attention shift -> product or policy adjustment, which matters because it changes who can move fastest.
Adjustment -> new defaults -> lock-in, which pushes smaller teams to adapt or exit.
Lock-in -> consolidation of workflow, which raises the cost of switching later.

## risk surface
- Over-rotation on the headline could mask second-order costs.
- Early adopters take execution risk while incumbents take narrative risk.
- If incentives misalign, the outcome becomes a short-lived spike instead of a durable shift.

## my take
I treat this as a directional signal, not a definitive answer. The right response is to adjust posture while keeping the option to reverse if the signal fades.
