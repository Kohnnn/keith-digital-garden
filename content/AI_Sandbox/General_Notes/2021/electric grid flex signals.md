# electric grid flex signals

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

Grid operators recorded demand response spikes as air conditioning loads flattened, linking to earlier energy narratives like [[nord stream 1 shutdown cements europe gas crunch]] and [[diesel inventories slip to crisis lows in us]].

## modules
- Flex signals now integrate weather forecasts similar to scenario planning in [[climate anxiety pushes infra teams into scenario planning]].
- Renewables adjustments tie back to supply chain reliability from [[shanghai lockdown stalls ports and factory calendars]].

## my take
I now watch demand response data as a micro leading indicator for energy stress.

## ending questions
Which demand response program proves resilient enough for year-round stress?
