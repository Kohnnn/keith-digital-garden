# framework laptop makes modular computing feel normal

Framework introduced a modular laptop built around replaceable parts and repairability
([Framework](https://frame.work/blog/introducing-the-framework-laptop)). The launch repositions
longevity as a product feature, not a hobbyist preference. I read it as a bet that repairability can
become a default expectation.

## evidence stack
- Replaceable modules and standardized parts reduce upgrade friction, which pushes resale value up.
- The product narrative centers repair guides and parts availability, signaling a business model
  beyond one-time hardware sales.
- The timing lines up with global supply constraints, making longevity a resilience strategy.

## constraint map
- Supply chain variability makes standardized parts harder to maintain over years.
- Right-to-repair policy momentum helps, but consumer habits still favor replacement.
- OEM margins rely on new device sales, so incentives push against modular defaults.

## time horizon
Short term, this is a niche for enthusiasts and enterprise procurement. Mid term, the strongest
signal is whether parts remain available across generations. Long term, the model works if hardware
brands treat lifecycle value as a differentiator, not a cost center.

## my take
I like the direction, but the real test is parts availability over time. A modular product without
parts is just a marketing story.

## ending questions
What would make repairability a default requirement in procurement checklists?
