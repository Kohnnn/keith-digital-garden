# marginalia search bets on text first web

Marginalia launched as a search engine that favors text-heavy sites and downranks modern SEO-heavy
design ([Marginalia](https://search.marginalia.nu/)). The project is less about scale and more about
taste in discovery. I read it as a reminder that search quality is partly a curatorial choice.

## constraint map
- Small crawlers cannot index the full web, so curation substitutes for breadth.
- Ranking models reflect values, and text-first bias is a deliberate tradeoff.
- Spam pressure will always push results toward gaming unless the incentives shift.

## counter-model
A niche search engine can be too small to matter and still rely on the same infrastructure it
critiques. That is fair, but the value is in offering an alternative signal, not in replacing Google.
A smaller index can still steer the conversation about what search should reward.

## linkage anchor
This pairs naturally with [[Google Search Is Dying]] and [[Google Search Quality Declines]] as a
practical counterpoint. It also complements [[RSS Brain]] as another bet on human-scale discovery.

## my take
I want more experiments like this. A single dominant ranking model is a cultural risk, not just a
technical one.

## ending questions
What ranking bias would I personally choose if I could design a search engine?
