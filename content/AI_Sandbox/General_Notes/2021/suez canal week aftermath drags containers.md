# suez canal week aftermath drags containers

The Ever Given blockage turned a narrow canal into a headline about supply fragility, echoing the port pressure in [[Port Congestion Squeeze]] and the shutdown lessons in [[shanghai lockdown stalls ports and factory calendars]].

## scene cut
Ships rerouted around the Cape of Good Hope, adding 7-10 days to voyages and causing carriers to cancel sailings.

## signal braid
- Signal: carriers now pre-book extra vessels, similar to the proactive planning in [[supply chain issues killing synth companies]].
- Signal: forwarder margins widened as diesel costs spiked (see [[diesel inventories slip to crisis lows in us]]).
- Noise: port operators blamed scripts; the real issue was lack of rerouting capacity.

## risk surface
- Backlogs intensified inflation pressure, reinforcing narratives in [[inflation hits 9.1 percent]].
- Multi-modal partners rang alarms about limited inland rail capacity.

## my take
Suez proved slacklessness. Digital twins that map chokepoints now get boardroom time.

## ending questions
Which back-up route will carriers trust next time a chokepoint clogs us?
