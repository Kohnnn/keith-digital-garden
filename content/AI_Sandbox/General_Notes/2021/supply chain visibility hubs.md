# supply chain visibility hubs

Logistics providers built visibility hubs that streamed PO, shipment, and weather data, echoing the pinch points described in [[Port Congestion Squeeze]] and [[shanghai lockdown stalls ports and factory calendars]].

## analysis stack
- Visibility allowed faster rerouting when port queues formed.
- Live dashboards tracked diesel price spikes linked to [[diesel inventories slip to crisis lows in us]].
- The hubs also mirrored the Slack/remote work adjustments captured in [[remote work normalizes across platforms]].

## my take
I now expect every global supply chain to deliver live feeds; without them, you operate blind.

## linkage

## ending questions
What visibility metric would have flagged the next disruption before it happened?
