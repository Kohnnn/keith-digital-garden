# 90 percent of nurses considering leaving

## scene cut
A report claimed 90% of nurses were considering leaving the profession, framing burnout as a systemic risk ([source](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/report-90-nurses-considering-leaving-profession-next-year)). The signal is about capacity, not just morale.

## signal braid
- Workforce fragility threatens system resilience.
- Burnout shows up as a policy constraint.
- Labor risk is now a healthcare risk.
- The labor cycle echoes [[Labor Shortage and the Quit Wave]].

## single-line take
Healthcare capacity is a labor story before it is a policy story.

## link hop
This links to [[Labor Shortage and the Quit Wave]] and [[Remote Work Normalizes]] and [[Young Adults and Mental Health Independence]].

## open loop
What retention levers actually move healthcare capacity?
