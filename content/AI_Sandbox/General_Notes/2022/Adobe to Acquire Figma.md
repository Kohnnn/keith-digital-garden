Adobe's plan to acquire Figma turned design tooling into a policy and pricing story. The risk is not only consolidation, but the slowing of competitive pressure that drives workflow innovation.

I read it as a platform power move. <span class="inline-claim">Creative tooling is now a strategic control point</span>.

> The acquisition would redefine power in the design software stack.

> [!question] Reflective question
> How much market power is too much for foundational creative tools?

## signals
- Design workflows are now strategic infrastructure.
- Pricing leverage grows as toolchains consolidate.
- Regulators watch product bundling more closely.
- User migration costs become a moat.

## my take
This deal puts a spotlight on dependency risk. If the tooling layer concentrates, the creative ecosystem becomes less flexible and more price-sensitive.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Moat:</strong> Workflow lock-in becomes pricing power.</li>
  <li><strong>Policy:</strong> Bundling raises competition concerns.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Toolchains are now strategic assets.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Innovation slows when exits disappear.</li>
</ul>
