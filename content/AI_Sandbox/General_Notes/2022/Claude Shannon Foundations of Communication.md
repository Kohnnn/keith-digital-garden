# claude shannon foundations of communication

## context shard
A profile of Claude Shannon traced how information theory laid the foundations for modern communication systems ([source](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-claude-shannons-information-theory-invented-the-future-20201222/)). It framed theory as infrastructure.

## signal stack
- Foundational theory shapes infrastructure decades later.
- Communication systems are built on elegant abstractions.
- Historical profiles teach how systems mature.
- The theme aligns with [[State of HTTP in 2022]].

## take line
Theory is a long-horizon investment that becomes invisible once it works.

## link trail
This links to [[State of HTTP in 2022]] and [[Sound Interactive]] and [[Mechanical Watch Interactive]].

## open loop
What current theories will feel inevitable in twenty years?
