The guilty verdict in the Theranos case marked the end of a long arc of hype, trust, and fraud. The signal was not just accountability; it was a reminder that storytelling can outrun verification.

I read it as a governance lesson for private markets. <span class="inline-note">Trust without proof is just leverage</span>.

> [!note] Core claim
> The verdict is a trust reset for high-velocity private markets.

> [!question] Reflective question
> How do we build faster verification without slowing innovation?

## signals
- Due diligence is now part of public narrative.
- Governance failures carry reputational aftershocks.
- Media amplification can distort risk signals.
- Founder mythology meets legal limits.

## my take
This is a credibility checkpoint. It will make investors and boards more cautious, but it also should push better verification standards in health tech.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Credibility must be earned continuously.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Narrative can mask technical debt.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Accountability is part of market hygiene.</li>
  <li><strong>Lesson:</strong> Governance scales with impact.</li>
</ul>
