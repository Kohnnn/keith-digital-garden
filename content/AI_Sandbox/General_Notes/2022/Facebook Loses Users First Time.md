Meta reported its first decline in daily active users, a milestone that signaled platform maturity. The reaction showed how much the market still anchors on growth metrics.

I read it as a signal about attention limits. <span class="inline-note">Saturation is the ceiling of scale</span>.

## signals
- Growth metrics are a fragile story anchor.
- Attention has a ceiling even for giants.
- Product focus shifts to retention and monetization.
- Investor patience resets quickly.

## my take
This is the moment the market saw Meta as a mature system. That forces a sharper focus on efficiency, which shows up in products and culture.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Ceiling:</strong> Attention is finite at scale.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Growth slows before revenue does.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Monetization pressure can erode trust.</li>
  <li><strong>Shift:</strong> Product bets must justify cost.</li>
</ul>
