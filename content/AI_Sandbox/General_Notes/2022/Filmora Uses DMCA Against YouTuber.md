# filmora uses dmca against youtuber

*see also:* [[LLMs]] · [[Model Behavior]]

## context shard
A YouTuber reported a DMCA takedown after criticizing Filmora's license change ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMIIwQZMFLE)). The story became a case study in platform leverage over creators.

## signal stack
- Licensing changes can trigger trust breaks.
- Platform power shapes creator risk exposure.
- Enforcement tools can be used as pressure tactics.
- Governance volatility echoes [[Twitter Suspends Paul Graham Account]].

## take line
When enforcement is easy, it becomes a blunt instrument, not a precision tool.

## link trail
This sits near [[Trust in Platforms]] and [[Platform Accountability Cluster]] and [[Twitter Accepts Musk Offer]].

## open loop
What guardrails can prevent policy tools from becoming retaliation?
