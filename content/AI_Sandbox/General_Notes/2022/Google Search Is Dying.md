# google search is dying

## context shard
The essay argued that search feels less useful and more gamed, pointing to a steady decline in relevance and trust ([source](https://dkb.io/post/google-search-is-dying)). The takeaway is not a single bug, but a long erosion of confidence in discovery.

## signal stack
- Perceived quality decline changes user behavior faster than metrics.
- SEO pressure distorts relevance signals.
- Community curation gains value as a substitute.
- The critique lines up with [[Google Search Quality Declines]].

## take line
When search feels unreliable, discovery becomes a trust problem, not a feature problem.

## link trail
This connects to [[Google Search Quality Declines]] and [[RSS Brain]] and [[Trust in Platforms]].

## open loop
What would restore confidence in an index without changing the incentives behind it?
