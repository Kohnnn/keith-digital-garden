# Google Search Quality Declines

<div class="keyword-row">
  <span class="inline-keyword">search</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">quality</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">trust</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">platform</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">noise</span>
</div>

A short thread captured a broad feeling: search results no longer feel high quality in important categories. It is a small statement that reflects a larger frustration about discovery.

I read it as a trust decay signal. <span class="inline-note">Relevance is a product promise</span>.

  <summary>context</summary>
  <p>Search feels worse long before it is declared broken.</p>
</details>

> [!note] Core claim
> Search quality is now a public trust issue, not just a ranking problem.

> [!question] Reflective question
> How do platforms recover when quality is perceived to slip?

## signals
- Search quality perception is deteriorating.
- Users rely more on curated sources.
- Discovery shifts toward social and direct channels.
- Platform trust is tied to relevance.

## my take
This is the type of public signal that matters more than metrics. When users say the product feels worse, the trust clock starts.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Relevance is credibility.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Perception drives behavior.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Quality declines move users away.</li>
  <li><strong>Platform:</strong> Discovery is the core product.</li>
</ul>
