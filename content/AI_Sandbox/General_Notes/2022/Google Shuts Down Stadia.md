Google's decision to shut down Stadia turned into a platform trust story. The move showed how cloud gaming still depends on long-term commitments that are hard to verify.

I read it as a reminder about platform risk. <span class="inline-claim">Cloud services inherit the trust of their operators</span>.

  <p>Shutdowns are remembered longer than launches.</p>

> [!note] Core claim
> Stadia's shutdown increased skepticism toward platform durability.

> [!question] Reflective question
> How do users price the risk of platform exit?

## signals
- Platform trust can be lost quickly.
- Cloud services require visible commitment.
- Developers face dependency risk on host platforms.
- Brand credibility influences adoption.

## my take
The shutdown strengthens the case for control and portability. It shifts demand toward platforms that can prove long-term support.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Platform exits are reputational costs.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Longevity becomes a selling point.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Dependency limits adoption.</li>
  <li><strong>Platform:</strong> Ownership of infrastructure matters.</li>
</ul>
