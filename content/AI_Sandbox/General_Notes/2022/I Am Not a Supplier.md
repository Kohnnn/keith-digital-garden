# I Am Not a Supplier

<div class="keyword-row">
  <span class="inline-keyword">supplier</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">contracts</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">power</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">risk</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">pricing</span>
</div>

The essay pushed back on the framing of vendors as interchangeable suppliers. It emphasized power dynamics and the difference between partnerships and extraction.

I read it as a leverage signal. <span class="inline-note">Pricing is a power story, not just a number</span>.

<details>
  <summary>context</summary>
  <p>Language shapes how contracts are negotiated.</p>
</details>

> [!note] Core claim
> Vendor relationships depend on power structure, not just service delivery.

> [!question] Reflective question
> What language choices signal unequal relationships in contracts?

## signals
- Supplier framing shifts bargaining power.
- Contracts encode relationship assumptions.
- Pricing disputes reveal dependency risk.
- Partnership language can change incentives.

## my take
The strongest part is the framing. If you let the other side define the relationship, the terms follow.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Power:</strong> Language sets negotiation posture.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Labels guide contract behavior.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Dependency increases leverage loss.</li>
  <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Rates reflect power balance.</li>
</ul>
