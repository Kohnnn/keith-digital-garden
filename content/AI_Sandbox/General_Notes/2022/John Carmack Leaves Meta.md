John Carmack's departure from Meta was a signal about internal alignment and the pace of execution. The resignation letter pointed to friction between ambition and delivery.

I read it as a leadership clarity moment. <span class="inline-note">Long-horizon bets need short-horizon wins</span>.

  <p>Execution friction shows up when timelines stretch.</p>
</details>

> [!note] Core claim
> Leadership exits expose the cost of slow execution on big bets.

> [!question] Reflective question
> How much patience does a platform bet require before it breaks?

## signals
- Long-horizon projects need measurable milestones.
- Leadership exits create confidence shocks.
- Cultural friction slows product velocity.
- Investment narratives need visible proof.

## my take
This is a warning about execution drag. Vision is not enough if internal systems cannot deliver milestones that keep trust alive.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Leadership exits are trust events.</li>
  <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Milestones sustain long bets.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Execution lag erodes confidence.</li>
  <li><strong>Culture:</strong> Velocity is a leadership responsibility.</li>
</ul>
