# meta lays off 11000

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

## context shard
Meta announced layoffs affecting 11,000 employees, framing the move as a reset toward efficiency ([source](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/mark-zuckerberg-layoff-message-to-employees/)). The message repositioned scale as cost discipline rather than expansion.

## signal stack
- Growth narratives flipped to efficiency narratives.
- Labor expectations shifted toward stability and caution.
- Long-horizon bets faced higher internal hurdles.
- Leadership strain showed up later in [[John Carmack Leaves Meta]].

## take line
This was a sector-wide signal that the growth era had paused.

## link trail
This connects to [[John Carmack Leaves Meta]] and [[Meta and the AR Bet]] and [[Platform Accountability Cluster]].

## open loop
How long does a cost reset shape product risk appetite?
