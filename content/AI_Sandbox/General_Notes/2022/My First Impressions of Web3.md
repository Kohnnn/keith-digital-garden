# My First Impressions of Web3

<div class="keyword-row">
  <span class="inline-keyword">web3</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">trust</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">identity</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">narrative</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">risk</span>
</div>

The essay positioned web3 as a governance and identity problem more than a technical one. It questioned whether decentralization can deliver the user experience and trust that platforms already provide.

I read it as a narrative check. <span class="inline-claim">Infrastructure stories fail when they ignore user incentives</span>.

<details>
  <summary>context</summary>
  <p>The critique focused on incentives, identity, and the cost of coordination.</p>
</details>

> [!note] Core claim
> Web3 debates are as much about governance as they are about technology.

> [!question] Reflective question
> What tradeoffs are users willing to accept for decentralization?

## signals
- Governance is the hidden complexity layer.
- Identity and coordination are still unsolved.
- Trust shifts depend on usability, not ideology.
- Narratives can run ahead of product reality.

## my take
The key value is the framing. It pushes the discussion toward incentives and governance instead of hype and slogans.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Incentives:</strong> User behavior determines adoption.</li>
  <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Usability is a trust lever.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Coordination costs are underestimated.</li>
  <li><strong>Narrative:</strong> Claims need operational proofs.</li>
</ul>
