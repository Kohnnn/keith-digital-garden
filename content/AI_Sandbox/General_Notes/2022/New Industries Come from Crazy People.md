# new industries come from crazy people

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

## context shard
The essay argued that new industries are born from people willing to look unreasonable, because early belief is scarce ([source](https://www.palladiummag.com/2021/02/02/new-industries-come-from-crazy-people/)). It treats innovation as a social and cultural process, not just technical progress.

## signal stack
- Early-stage belief is a scarce resource.
- Social permission matters as much as funding.
- Narrative creates room for experimentation.
- The framing echoes [[Markets of Narrative]].

## take line
Conviction is part of the capital stack when facts are still thin.

## link trail
This aligns with [[Markets of Narrative]] and [[Trust in Platforms]] and [[Energy Shock Cluster]].

## open loop
How do we distinguish productive conviction from ungrounded hype?
