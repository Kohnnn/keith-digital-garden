# openbsd mastery not in kindle store

## context shard
A publisher explained why OpenBSD Mastery was excluded from Amazon's Kindle store, pointing to platform rules and gatekeeping ([source](https://mwl.io/archives/22466)). It surfaces a quiet tension between distribution reach and platform control.

## signal stack
- Gatekeeping shapes what becomes accessible.
- Platform rules can override author intent.
- Distribution depends on compliance, not just quality.
- The dynamic mirrors [[Trust in Platforms]].

## take line
Distribution power is a policy layer disguised as a marketplace.

## link trail
This links to [[Trust in Platforms]] and [[Platform Accountability Cluster]] and [[I Am Not a Supplier]].

## open loop
What alternate distribution paths reduce platform dependence?
