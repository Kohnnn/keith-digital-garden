# practice typing by retyping novels

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

## context shard
TypeLit turns classic novels into typing practice, emphasizing long-form repetition over drills ([source](https://www.typelit.io/)). It reframes skill building as immersion rather than metrics.

## signal stack
- Long-form repetition builds focus endurance.
- Tools can make practice feel like reading.
- Habit formation depends on low-friction interfaces.
- Focus tools align with the curation ethos of [[RSS Brain]].

## take line
This is a good example of a tool that improves skill by changing the texture of practice.

## link trail
It connects to [[RSS Brain]] and [[I Regret My Website Redesign]] and [[Google Search Is Dying]].

## open loop
What other skills could be trained by reusing long-form content?
