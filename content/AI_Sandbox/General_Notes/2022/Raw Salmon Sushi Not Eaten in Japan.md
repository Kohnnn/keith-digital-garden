# raw salmon sushi not eaten in japan

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

## context shard
A thread noted that raw salmon sushi was not common in Japan until relatively recently, tied to trade and marketing history ([source](https://twitter.com/trungtphan/status/1608176899804782592)). It reframed a cultural assumption as a distribution story.

## signal stack
- Food traditions can be shaped by trade incentives.
- Marketing can become cultural memory.
- Myths persist when distribution hides origins.
- The lens echoes [[Markets of Narrative]].

## take line
Culture is often a supply chain story in disguise.

## link trail
This connects to [[Markets of Narrative]] and [[Supply Chains as Policy]] and [[Port Congestion Squeeze]].

## open loop
Which other "traditions" are actually recent logistics wins?
