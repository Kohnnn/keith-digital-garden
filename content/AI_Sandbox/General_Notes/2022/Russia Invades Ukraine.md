The full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 reset the European security map overnight. The event was military, but the ripple effects were economic, energy, and political.

I read it as a permanent repricing of risk. Defense planning, energy policy, and capital allocation all shifted, and they did so under real time pressure. <span class="inline-claim">Security became the constraint for everything else</span>.

The energy layer became the clearest proof. Gas dependence turned into strategic vulnerability, and the sanction regime forced a rapid search for substitutes.

## signals
- Security policy now sets the pace for economic planning.
- Energy dependence converts into hard geopolitical leverage.
- Sanctions reshape supply chains and investment timelines.
- Alliance credibility becomes a measurable risk factor.
- Regional conflict spills into global commodity pricing.

## my take
This was the moment where energy stopped being a technical policy file and became a security file. The aftershocks are not temporary because the trust layer is damaged. That means higher friction is the default, not the exception.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Defense risk is now capital risk.</li>
  <li><strong>Energy:</strong> Supply chains mirror alliances.</li>
  <li><strong>Policy:</strong> Sanctions are a long-duration lever.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Security planning has an inflation tail.</li>
  <li><strong>Shift:</strong> Resilience spending is structural, not cyclical.</li>
</ul>
