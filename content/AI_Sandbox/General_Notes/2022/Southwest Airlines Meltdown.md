Southwest's holiday meltdown showed how brittle scheduling systems become under stress. The operational failure became a public trust event.

I read it as a systems debt story. <span class="inline-claim">Ops debt accumulates until a crisis makes it visible</span>.

<details>
  <summary>context</summary>
  <p>Weather exposed a fragile staffing and scheduling stack.</p>
</details>

> [!note] Core claim
> Operational resilience is a trust requirement, not a cost line.

> [!question] Reflective question
> What other critical systems are running with hidden ops debt?

## signals
- Scheduling systems can be single points of failure.
- Labor constraints amplify technical fragility.
- Public trust erodes quickly under chaos.
- Resilience investment is forced by crisis.

## my take
This is a warning about under-investing in systems that only show value when everything breaks. It is also a labor signal, not just a technical one.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Debt:</strong> Operational shortcuts compound.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Reliability is brand trust.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Stress tests arrive unannounced.</li>
  <li><strong>Labor:</strong> Scheduling tools are labor tools.</li>
</ul>
