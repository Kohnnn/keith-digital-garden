# surviving disillusionment

## context shard
The essay treated disillusionment as a normal phase after peak belief and promised a path to reconstruction ([source](https://www.spakhm.com/p/surviving-disillusionment)). It framed recovery as a rebuild of expectations rather than a failure.

## signal stack
- Disillusionment is a common cycle after hype.
- Recovery depends on realistic narratives.
- Belief systems can be rebuilt with smaller anchors.
- The arc echoes [[Markets of Narrative]].

## take line
Disillusionment is not the end; it is the moment where the story gets real.

## link trail
This connects to [[Markets of Narrative]] and [[Trust in Platforms]] and [[Work Without a Center]].

## open loop
What practices help rebuild belief without sliding into denial?
