# Tech Execs Raise Kids Tech-Free

<div class="keyword-row">
  <span class="inline-keyword">screens</span>

</div>

Reports about tech leaders limiting screen time for their kids underscored a growing skepticism toward device exposure. It is a credibility signal when insiders avoid their own products.

I read it as a trust gap signal. <span class="inline-claim">Insider behavior can contradict product narratives</span>.

<details>
  <summary>context</summary>
  <p>When product creators avoid their product, public trust erodes.</p>
</details>

> [!note] Core claim
> Insider screen-time limits are a signal about perceived product risk.

> [!question] Reflective question
> What does it mean when product builders limit their own use?

## signals
- Attention harm narratives are gaining traction.
- Parenting decisions shape product trust.
- Health concerns are no longer fringe.
- Platform accountability expands beyond policy.

## my take
The cultural signal is stronger than the article itself. People notice when insiders act differently than their marketing.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Behavior speaks louder than messaging.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Attention is now a health question.</li>
  <li><strong>Culture:</strong> Parenting choices affect public narratives.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Credibility gaps widen over time.</li>
</ul>
