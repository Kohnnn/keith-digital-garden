# things silicon valley gets wrong about agriculture

## context shard
The article argued that tech narratives often miss agriculture's constraints and incentives ([source](https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/5-things-silicon-valley-gets-wrong-about-agriculture/439229)). It reframes ag-tech as a systems problem, not a gadget problem.

## signal stack
- Incentives in agriculture differ from software markets.
- Labor realities limit automation assumptions.
- Policy shapes outcomes more than pilots do.
- This resonates with [[Supply Chains as Policy]].

## take line
Ag-tech bets fail when they ignore the on-the-ground incentive map.

## link trail
This connects to [[Supply Chains as Policy]] and [[Port Congestion Squeeze]] and [[Energy Shock Cluster]].

## open loop
Which ag-tech ideas survive when labor and policy are first-order constraints?
