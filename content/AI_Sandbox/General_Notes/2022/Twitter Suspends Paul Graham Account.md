The temporary suspension of Paul Graham's account became a proxy debate about platform rules and enforcement consistency. It added to the volatility narrative around policy changes.

I read it as a trust signal. <span class="inline-note">Policy volatility is a governance cost</span>.

<details>
  <summary>context</summary>
  <p>Rule changes feel arbitrary when enforcement shifts fast.</p>
</details>

> [!note] Core claim
> Inconsistent enforcement makes platform rules feel unstable.

> [!question] Reflective question
> How do platforms keep legitimacy when rules change quickly?

## signals
- Enforcement consistency affects user trust.
- Policy changes are now public narrative events.
- Platform governance is part of product risk.
- Trust is tied to predictable moderation.

## my take
This is small on its own, but the pattern matters. Users price in governance instability, which changes how they invest in a platform.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Consistency is the baseline.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Policy shifts are product signals.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Volatility pushes users to hedge.</li>
  <li><strong>Governance:</strong> Legitimacy needs visible rules.</li>
</ul>
