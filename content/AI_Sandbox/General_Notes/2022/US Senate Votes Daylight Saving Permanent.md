The Senate vote to make daylight saving time permanent showed how small policy shifts can ripple into daily life. It was a governance move tied to health, economics, and habit.

I read it as a coordination problem. <span class="inline-claim">Shared time is a public infrastructure layer</span>.

  <p>Time changes are tiny but universal, so they magnify quickly.</p>
</details>

> [!note] Core claim
> Time policy is a coordination tool, not a minor calendar tweak.

> [!question] Reflective question
> What other invisible rules shape daily behavior this much?

## signals
- Policy touches routines at scale.
- Health and productivity debates intersect in scheduling.
- Coordination costs show up in logistics and safety.
- Public consensus is harder for universal rules.

## my take
This is a reminder that governance is often about invisible scaffolding. People notice only when it breaks or changes.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Coordination:</strong> Shared rules reduce friction.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Routine changes surface hidden costs.</li>
  <li><strong>Health:</strong> Time policy affects sleep and safety.</li>
  <li><strong>Policy:</strong> Small changes can have big reach.</li>
</ul>
