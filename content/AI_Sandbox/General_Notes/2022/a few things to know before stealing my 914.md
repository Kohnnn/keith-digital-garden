# a few things to know before stealing my 914

## scene cut
A quirky essay explained why a specific Porsche is hard to steal, using humor to teach practical security ([source](https://www.hagerty.com/media/advice/a-few-things-to-know-before-you-steal-my-914/)). It makes threat modeling feel approachable.

## signal braid
- Security education works when it is concrete.
- Obscurity can still be a deterrent.
- Practical details beat abstract warnings.
- The playful teaching style aligns with [[Raspberry Pi Security Alarm Basics]].

## single-line take
Security lessons stick better when they feel personal.

## link hop
This links to [[Raspberry Pi Security Alarm Basics]] and [[Deceiving Windows Defender Big Stack Bypass]] and [[Trust in Platforms]].

## open loop
Where else could playful teaching improve security behavior?

## updates
