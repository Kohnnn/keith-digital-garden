# adobe tricks users into 12 month contract

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

## scene cut
A dark patterns report claimed Adobe steered users into a 12-month contract through confusing flows ([source](https://twitter.com/darkpatterns/status/1489901640777973768)). The episode framed pricing as a trust problem.

## signal braid
- Cancellation friction functions as hidden pricing.
- UX can act like policy enforcement.
- Trust drops when exits are unclear.
- The governance risk echoes [[Platform Accountability Cluster]].

## single-line take
Pricing tactics become reputation risk when they feel deceptive.
