I read ai-generated vs. human cocktail recipe as a constraint signal more than novelty. The link is just the anchor; the mechanics are where the leverage is ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKsyuCnaCGc)).

## scene
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[LLMs]] and [[Model Behavior]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## field notes
- The way ai-generated vs. human cocktail recipe is framed compresses complexity into a single promise.
- The first order win is clarity; the second order cost is optionality.
- What looks like a surface change is actually a control move.

## signal vs noise
- Noise: demos and commentary overstate production readiness.
- Signal: procurement and compliance are quietly shaping the outcome.
- Signal: incentives now favor stability over novelty.
- Noise: early excitement won’t survive the next budget cycle.

## exposure map
- Governance drift turns tactical choices around ai-generated vs. human cocktail recipe into strategic liabilities.
- The smallest edge case in ai-generated vs. human cocktail recipe becomes the largest reputational risk.
- ai-generated vs. human cocktail recipe amplifies model brittleness faster than the value it returns.

## my take
This is a boundary note for me. I’ll track it as a trend, not a one off.
