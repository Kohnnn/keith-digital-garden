I read ai  the world has changed fast–what might be next? as a constraint signal more than novelty. The link is just the anchor; the mechanics are where the leverage is ([source](https://singularityhub.com/2022/12/29/the-brief-history-of-artificial-intelligence-the-world-has-changed-fast-what-might-be-next/)).

## scene
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[Model Behavior]] and [[Compute Bottlenecks]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## notes from the surface
- What looks like a surface change is actually a control move.
- The first order win is clarity; the second order cost is optionality.
- The way ai  the world has changed fast–what might be next? is framed compresses complexity into a single promise.

## the dominoes
constraint tightens -> teams standardize -> defaults calcify
policy shift -> procurement changes -> roadmap narrows
surface change -> tooling adapts -> behavior hardens

## timing
Short term, this looks like a capability win. Mid term, it becomes a budgeting and compliance question. Long term, the dominant path is whichever reduces coordination cost.

## my take
I see this as a real signal with a short half life. Move fast, but don’t calcify.

## ending questions
Which constraint would need to loosen for this to reverse?
