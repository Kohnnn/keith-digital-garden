Apple announced Advanced Data Protection, expanding end-to-end encryption for iCloud data
([Apple](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/12/apple-advances-personal-data-protection-with-powerful-new-features/)).
The move pushes more privacy responsibility to users while shrinking Apple's ability to help with
account recovery. I read it as a strategic move to make privacy the default position.

## context + claim
Encryption is no longer a feature; it is an allocation of failure modes. My claim: Apple is moving
the recovery burden to the user so the platform can credibly refuse access demands at scale.

## counter-model
Skeptics can argue that the default remains off, so the practical impact is limited. They can also
point to recovery complexity as a barrier. Those are real concerns, but the shift in posture matters:
Apple is signaling that privacy is worth friction.

## risk surface
- Recovery friction moves from support to the user, creating a new class of self‑inflicted loss.
- Bad actors lose server-side access, but ordinary users lose the safety net too.
- Regulators may respond by pushing for weaker defaults elsewhere.

## decision boundary
If adoption climbs without a spike in account loss, I will treat this as a real default shift. If it
creates headline‑level recovery failures, the rollback pressure will be immediate.

## my take
I like the direction, but the real test is whether people can survive the new recovery model.

## ending questions
How much account recovery friction is acceptable to keep encryption strong?
