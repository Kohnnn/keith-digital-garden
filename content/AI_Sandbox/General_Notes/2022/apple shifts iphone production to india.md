# apple shifts iphone production to india

*see also:* [[Product Positioning]] · [[Default Settings]]

I read this as a risk‑balancing move, not a cost move. Apple is trading efficiency for resilience.

## scene cut
Reports said Apple planned to move 40–45% of iPhone production to India ([source](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-china-factory-protests-foxconn-manufacturing-production-supply-chain-11670023099)). The shift signals a re‑allocation of geopolitical exposure.

## signal braid
- Production geography is now a strategic variable.
- Resilience costs more than concentration.
- Supplier alignment becomes political compliance.
- The shift echoes [[Vietnam Lockdowns and Factory Disruptions]].

## mini ledger
- cost: higher operational complexity.
- benefit: reduced single‑country risk.
- unknown: how fast quality scales in new hubs.

## link hop
This links to [[Supply Chains as Policy]] and [[China's Power Crunch]] and [[Vietnam Lockdowns and Factory Disruptions]].

## my take
I think the key is not India itself but the optionality it creates. Apple is paying for redundancy, which only looks expensive until the next shock.

## ending questions
How much redundancy is the right price for global hardware brands?
