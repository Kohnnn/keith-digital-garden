The headline makes it feel settled. It isn’t. as liquid cooling takes off in the datacenter, fortune favors the brave is moving the line on what people accept as normal, and that is the part I care about ([source](https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/29/liquid_cooling_now/)).

*see also:* [[Model Behavior]] · [[LLMs]]
## set up
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[Model Behavior]] and [[LLMs]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## what i see
- The first order win is clarity; the second order cost is optionality.
- The dependency chain around as liquid cooling takes off in the datacenter, fortune favors the brave is where risk accumulates, not at the surface.
- The operational details around as liquid cooling takes off in the datacenter, fortune favors the brave matter more than the announcement cadence.

## system motion
surface change -> tooling adapts -> behavior hardens
policy shift -> procurement changes -> roadmap narrows
constraint tightens -> teams standardize -> defaults calcify

## duration
Short term, this looks like a capability win. Mid term, it becomes a budgeting and compliance question. Long term, the dominant path is whichever reduces coordination cost.

## my take
I’m leaning toward treating this as structural. Build for the default that’s forming, but keep an exit path.

## ending questions
If the incentives flipped, what would stay sticky?
