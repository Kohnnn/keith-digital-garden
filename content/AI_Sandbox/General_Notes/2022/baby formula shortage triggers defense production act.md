# baby formula shortage triggers defense production act

After months of empty shelves tied to Abbott's Sturgis recall, President Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to prioritize ingredients and launched "Operation Fly Formula" airlifts for imported supply ([White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/18/fact-sheet-president-biden-invokes-defense-production-act-to-accelerate-domestic-manufacturing-of-infant-formula/)). Infant nutrition became a national security issue.

## scene cut
Abbott's plant had been offline since February, and WIC program rules limited alternative brands. Parents were driving hours to find powder; some diluted formula, risking health crises. The DPA move forced suppliers to fill formula orders before other packaged goods.

## signal braid
- This is the consumer-facing version of the supply fragility cataloged in [[shanghai lockdown stalls ports and factory calendars]].
- Retailers already struggling with freight surcharges from [[diesel inventories slip to crisis lows in us]] now had to add rationing protocols.
- Military aircraft hauling Nestlé and Danone product underscored how limited domestic diversity is in this market.
- FDA fast-tracked clearances for foreign producers, hinting at longer-term regulatory shifts.

## constraint map
- Only a handful of U.S. plants make most powdered formula.
- FDA consent decrees take weeks to lift even after contamination is addressed.
- WIC contracts restrict brand switching, slowing adoption of imports.

## link hop
This event lines up with [[us rail strike averted by tentative labor deal]] because both show how quickly consumer goods can be kneecapped by a single facility or policy bottleneck.

## my take
Food supply chains look diversified on paper, but oligopolies mean a single safety issue cascades nationally. The DPA shouldn't have been the first time we heard about concentration risk here.

## ending questions
Will FDA permanently loosen import rules to prevent another shortage, or will domestic incumbents keep the moat locked up once headlines fade?
