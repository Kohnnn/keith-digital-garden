# but life had other plans

## scene cut
A short essay described how plans collapse and re-form over time, anchoring the story in lived experience ([source](https://danlebrero.com/2022/03/23/but-life-had-other-plans/)). It reads like a reminder that trajectories are rarely linear.

## signal braid
- Narrative resets are part of long projects.
- Resilience is shaped by timing, not just will.
- The emotional arc mirrors [[Surviving Disillusionment]].
- Planning horizons shorten under uncertainty.

## single-line take
Plans are scaffolding, not guarantees.

## link hop
This links to [[Surviving Disillusionment]] and [[Work Without a Center]] and [[Markets of Narrative]].

## open loop
What helps a long-term plan survive the first major detour?
