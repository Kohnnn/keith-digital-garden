# celsius freezes withdrawals and sparks retail panic

*see also:* [[LLMs]] · [[Model Behavior]]

Celsius froze withdrawals for its 1.7M users, citing "extreme market conditions" after Terra and broader crypto leverage collapsed ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-firm-celsius-pauses-withdrawals-and-transfers-between-accounts-2022-06-13/)). The decision validated every fear that crypto lending desks were rehypothecating collateral without adult supervision.

## scene cut
The freeze happened during a weekend gap, meaning users watched prices fall while their assets were locked inside a platform that marketed itself as a bank alternative. Celsius also paused swaps and transfers, so even internal accounts were useless. It was a full stop, not a speed bump.

## evidence stack
- Celsius allegedly had a $1.2B hole tied to stETH and UST exposure, which mirrored the leverage loops called out in [[terrausd death spiral wipes out anchor trust]].
- The firm promised 8-17% APY, making it indistinguishable from the "free yield" narratives I flagged in [[My First Impressions of Web3]].
- Macro stress was rising at the same time, with [[inflation hits 9.1 percent]] telling everyone that cheap money was gone.
- Celsius sent more collateral to FTX and other venues even as it told customers operations were paused, hinting at triage behind the curtain.

## risk surface
- A Celsius bankruptcy drags lenders like Voyager, BlockFi, and 3AC deeper underwater.
- Every centralized lender now faces a run risk at the first rumor.
- Regulators have clear justification to treat CeFi yields like securities offerings.

## link hop
This event is the middle node between [[terrausd death spiral wipes out anchor trust]] and the insolvency waves that follow in [[three arrows liquidation exposes leverage maze]].

## my take
CeFi without transparency is the same as shadow banking in 2008—attractive deposits masking asset-liability mismatches. The only safe assumption is that centralized yield platforms are levered to exactly the wrong collateral.

## ending questions
Would real-time proof-of-liabilities dashboards have slowed the freeze, or were the holes too large for any disclosure to matter?
