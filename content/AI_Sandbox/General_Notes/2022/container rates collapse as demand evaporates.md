# container rates collapse as demand evaporates

Freightos and Drewry indexes showed Transpacific container rates down more than 75% year-over-year, with Shanghai–Los Angeles dropping below $3,800 as retailers slashed orders ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/14/shipping-rates-drop-75percent-as-demand-sinks.html)). The freight bull market is officially over.

## scene cut
Carriers are canceling sailings and idling capacity to stop the slide, but contract rates are now under pressure. Warehouses remain full, meaning importers are in no hurry to restock.

## signal braid
- It's the inverse of the congestion story documented in [[shanghai lockdown stalls ports and factory calendars]].
- Cheap rates help offset energy spikes like [[us gasoline jumps past five dollars nationwide]] but also confirm that consumer demand is rolling over.
- Trucking spot rates and parcel volumes echo the same slowdown.
- Carriers will blank more sailings, which risks future capacity crunches when demand returns.

## risk surface
- Aggressive capacity cuts can create another bullwhip if demand rebounds suddenly.
- Retailers could overcorrect on inventory, inviting stockouts.
- Carrier alliances face antitrust scrutiny if they coordinate too tightly.

## link hop
This note pairs with [[rhine drought grounds barges and factories]] because both illustrate how transport costs swing wildly based on environmental or demand shocks.

## my take
Freight went from scarcity to surplus within months. It reinforces how fragile demand forecasting is when macro policy whipsaws.

## ending questions
Will carriers embrace truly dynamic pricing, or will alliances keep trying to finely tune blank sailings as a blunt instrument?
