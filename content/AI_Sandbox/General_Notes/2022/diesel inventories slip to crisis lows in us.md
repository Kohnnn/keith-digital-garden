# diesel inventories slip to crisis lows in us

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

The U.S. entered late October with only 25 days of diesel supply on hand, the lowest seasonal level since 2008, as refiners struggled to juggle domestic demand, exports, and maintenance ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/24/us-diesel-supply-is-low-winter-shortage-possible.html)). Freight carriers started planning for allocations.

## scene cut
Diesel powers trucking, rail, agriculture, and heating oil in the Northeast. Inventories were drained by exports to Europe (to backfill [[nord stream 1 shutdown cements europe gas crunch]]) and hurricane-related outages. Prices blew out relative to gasoline and crude benchmarks.

## signal braid
- Diesel spikes feed every other cost structure, reinforcing the CPI pressure noted in [[us gasoline jumps past five dollars nationwide]].
- Retailers worry about stockouts because freight surcharges lead to tighter ordering.
- East Coast governors asked the White House for waivers and fuel redistribution, hinting at rationing plans.
- Refiners delayed maintenance to keep distillate units online longer.

## risk surface
- Cold snaps in the Northeast could force fuel switching or emergency releases from the heating oil reserve.
- Export restrictions would punish allies counting on U.S. barrels.
- Persistent price spreads accelerate inflation for groceries and e-commerce.

## my take
Diesel is the stealth macro driver; when it gets tight, everything else becomes reactive. I'm watching distillate cracks more closely than Fed speeches.

## ending questions
What would it take to rebuild East Coast storage capacity enough that a single refinery outage doesn't trigger rationing rumors?
