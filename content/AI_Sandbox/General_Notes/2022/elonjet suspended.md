# elonjet suspended

## scene cut
The ElonJet account was suspended after tracking public jet data, reopening questions about platform policy and privacy ([source](https://twitter.com/jxcksweeney/status/1603028610209779712)). The case sits between transparency and safety.

## signal braid
- Platform rules shift under public pressure.
- Privacy norms can conflict with public data access.
- Enforcement volatility mirrors [[Twitter Suspends Paul Graham Account]].
- Trust depends on consistent policy lines.

## single-line take
Policy legitimacy erodes when enforcement feels ad hoc.

## link hop
This links to [[Twitter Suspends Paul Graham Account]] and [[Twitter Accepts Musk Offer]] and [[Trust in Platforms]].

## open loop
What privacy boundary is reasonable for public data tracking?

## updates
- 2025-01-22: Seed draft from 2022 backfill. Pending manual review.
