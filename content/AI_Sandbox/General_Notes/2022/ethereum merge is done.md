# ethereum merge is done

## scene cut
The Ethereum merge completed the shift to proof of stake, ending a multi-year upgrade path ([source](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/09/15/the-ethereum-merge-is-done-did-it-work/)). The change reset energy narratives and operational risk.

## signal braid
- Consensus upgrades are now live-system events.
- Energy narratives shifted toward sustainability claims.
- Execution risk was the real market test.
- The policy arc connects to [[Crypto Policy Sprint 2021]].

## single-line take
The merge was a credibility test more than a technical one.

## link hop
This links to [[Crypto Policy Sprint 2021]] and [[Markets of Narrative]] and [[Trust in Platforms]].

## open loop
Which layer of Ethereum’s roadmap now carries the most credibility risk?
