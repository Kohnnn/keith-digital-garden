# eu digital markets act approved

*see also:* [[Product Positioning]] · [[Default Settings]]

The DMA feels like a structural shift in how Europe regulates platform power. I read it as a long-term constraint on default behaviors.

## scene cut
The EU approved the Digital Markets Act, targeting gatekeeper platforms with new competition rules ([source](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/07/18/dma-council-gives-final-approval-to-new-rules-for-fair-competition-online/)). The law formalizes expectations that were previously just political talk.

## signal braid
- Platform defaults are now legally constrained.
- Compliance becomes a core product requirement.
- Competition is being enforced at the UX layer.
- The move aligns with [[Platform Accountability Cluster]].

## single-line take
Regulation is moving from fines to design constraints.

## my take
I think the DMA will be most impactful where platforms used convenience to entrench lock-in. It shifts the center of gravity from growth to compliance.

## ending questions
Which UX defaults will regulators target next?
