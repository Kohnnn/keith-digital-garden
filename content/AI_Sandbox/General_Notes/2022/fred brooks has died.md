# fred brooks has died

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

The news felt like the end of a foundational era in software thinking. I keep his influence in mind whenever complexity outpaces coordination.

## scene cut
Fred Brooks' death was announced by colleagues, marking the loss of a key voice in software systems and management ([source](https://twitter.com/stevebellovin/status/1593414068634734592)). It is a reminder that most of our systems culture is inherited.

## signal braid
- Foundational ideas still shape modern systems.
- Leadership philosophy travels across generations.
- Complexity is still a people problem.
- The historical arc aligns with [[Claude Shannon Foundations of Communication]].

## single-line take
Software culture is built on a small set of durable ideas.

## my take
I see this as a prompt to re-read the fundamentals, not chase the newest abstractions. The core constraints haven’t changed; our tolerance for complexity just keeps rising.

## ending questions
Which classic ideas should be re-taught to modern teams?
