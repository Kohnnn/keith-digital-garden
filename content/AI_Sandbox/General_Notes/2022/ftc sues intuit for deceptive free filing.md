# ftc sues intuit for deceptive free filing

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

## scene cut
The FTC sued Intuit over claims about "free" TurboTax filing, arguing the marketing was deceptive ([source](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/03/ftc-sues-intuit-its-deceptive-turbotax-free-filing-campaign)). It positioned consumer trust as an enforcement issue.

## signal braid
- Marketing claims are now regulatory targets.
- Trust breaks follow pricing ambiguity.
- Enforcement is expanding beyond data privacy.
- The pattern echoes [[Platform Accountability Cluster]].

## single-line take
Consumer trust becomes a legal risk when pricing is opaque.

## link hop
This connects to [[Platform Accountability Cluster]] and [[Trust in Platforms]] and [[Adobe to Acquire Figma]].

## open loop
What disclosures should be mandatory for pricing claims?
