# ftx bankruptcy reveals multibillion balance hole

FTX filed for Chapter 11 protection alongside Alameda and 130 affiliates, and Sam Bankman-Fried resigned as CEO after an $8B liquidity hole surfaced ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/ftx-starts-us-bankruptcy-proceedings-founder-resigns-2022-11-11/)). The supposed lender of last resort became the largest liability on everyone's balance sheet.

## scene cut
Customer deposits were allegedly loaned to Alameda with little collateral, and internal controls were so weak that new CEO John Ray called it "a complete failure of corporate governance." The filing confirmed that a major exchange had no board oversight, no CFO, and no idea where the cash went.

## signal braid
- Every distressed lender that hoped for an FTX bailout now has to mark assets to reality, amplifying the losses from [[three arrows liquidation exposes leverage maze]].
- The unwinding validates the skepticism I logged in [[terrausd death spiral wipes out anchor trust]] about reflexive collateral masquerading as dollars.
- Regulators received a political mandate to separate exchange, custody, and market-making functions.
- Counterparties instantly demanded proof-of-reserves, forcing new transparency standards.

## risk surface
- Credit contagion spreads to miners and market-makers who parked operational capital on FTX.
- Retail loss of trust threatens liquidity for every centralized exchange.
- Policy backlash could push heavy-handed rules that treat all of DeFi like a security offering.

## link hop
This note links directly to the compliance pressure described in [[tornado cash sanctions redraw crypto privacy lines]] and also reframes earlier optimism from [[ethereum merge is done]].

## my take
FTX collapsed because unchecked related-party lending is still fraud even when it's tokenized. Every exchange now has to earn trust daily; logos alone won't cut it.

## ending questions
What transparency standard would make me comfortable holding either working capital or personal funds on an exchange again?
