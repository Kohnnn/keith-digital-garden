# g7 price cap gambit targets russian revenue

G7 nations and the EU finalized a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian seaborne oil, tying access to Western insurance and shipping to compliance ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/g7-eu-agree-60-barrel-price-cap-russian-seaborne-oil-2022-12-02/)). The scheme tries to depress Kremlin revenue while keeping barrels on the market.

## scene cut
The cap complements the EU embargo beginning December 5. Enforcement hinges on the dominance of Western insurers like Lloyd's: carrying Russian crude above the cap voids coverage. Buyers like India and China can still negotiate below the cap without losing access to services.

## signal braid
- This is the policy follow-through to the weaponized flows described in [[nord stream 1 shutdown cements europe gas crunch]].
- Price caps risk retaliation that might worsen the pump pain recorded in [[us gasoline jumps past five dollars nationwide]].
- Russia has to decide whether shutting in production hurts it more than discounted sales.
- The move tests how cohesive the sanctions coalition remains heading into 2023.

## decision boundary
If Russia diverts enough shipments with its own "shadow fleet," the cap loses bite; if G7 enforcement actually blocks tankers, expect crude prices to spike. I will change my view if Urals trades persistently above the cap without visible penalties.

## link hop
This note connects energy geopolitics to downstream logistics like [[diesel inventories slip to crisis lows in us]] because any disruption flows straight into refined product margins.

## my take
The cap is a novel use of financial infrastructure as leverage. It only works if insurers enforce paperwork with zero wiggle room.

## ending questions
Will nonaligned shippers risk losing Western insurance for higher spot prices, or is the cap quietly accepted as the new floor?
