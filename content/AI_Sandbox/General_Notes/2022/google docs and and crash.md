# google docs and and crash

## scene cut
A Google Docs bug caused crashes when repeating "And" in a specific pattern, exposing fragile edge behavior ([source](https://support.google.com/docs/thread/162510194/including-and-and-and-and-and-in-a-google-doc-causes-it-to-crash?hl=en)). It turned a tiny input into a reliability story.

## signal braid
- UX reliability depends on handling weird inputs.
- Edge cases become trust events when widely shared.
- Platform stability is a product differentiator.
- The fragility echoes [[macos cannot open non-apple apps]].

## single-line take
Reliability is proven at the edges, not the center.

## link hop
This links to [[macos cannot open non-apple apps]] and [[State of HTTP in 2022]] and [[Trust in Platforms]].

## open loop
Which other everyday tools fail on simple edge cases?

## updates
- 2025-01-30: Seed draft from 2022 backfill. Pending manual review.
