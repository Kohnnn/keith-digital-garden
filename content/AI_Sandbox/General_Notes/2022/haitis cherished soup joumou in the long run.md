The headline makes it feel settled. It isn’t. haiti's cherished soup joumou is moving the line on what people accept as normal, and that is the part I care about ([source](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/haitis-beloved-soup-joumou-serves-up-freedom-in-every-bowl-180981378/)).

## set up
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[Model Behavior]] and [[LLMs]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## what i see
- The first order win is clarity; the second order cost is optionality.
- The dependency chain around haiti's cherished soup joumou is where risk accumulates, not at the surface.
- The operational details around haiti's cherished soup joumou matter more than the announcement cadence.

## system motion
surface change -> tooling adapts -> behavior hardens
policy shift -> procurement changes -> roadmap narrows
constraint tightens -> teams standardize -> defaults calcify

## duration
Short term, this looks like a capability win. Mid term, it becomes a budgeting and compliance question. Long term, the dominant path is whichever reduces coordination cost.

## my take
I’m leaning toward treating this as structural. Build for the default that’s forming, but keep an exit path.

## ending questions
If the incentives flipped, what would stay sticky?
