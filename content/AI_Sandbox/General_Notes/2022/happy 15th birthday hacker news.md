# happy 15th birthday hacker news

Fifteen years of continuity is rare in tech communities. I read it as proof that slow culture can outlast fast platforms.

## scene cut
Hacker News marked its 15th birthday with a look back at early front pages ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/front?day=2007-02-19&p=1)). The moment frames community endurance as a design outcome.

## signal braid
- Durable communities rely on clear norms.
- Slow feeds beat hype cycles over time.
- Trust grows when rules stay consistent.
- The curation ethos aligns with [[RSS Brain]].

## contrast seam
default read: nostalgia / counter read: proof of governance design.

## my take
I think the real lesson is that governance and tone are product features. When they are stable, the community can evolve without collapsing.

## ending questions
What other communities can survive on slow, stable governance?
