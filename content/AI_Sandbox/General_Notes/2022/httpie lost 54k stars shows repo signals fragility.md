# httpie lost 54k stars shows repo signals fragility

HTTPie reported losing tens of thousands of GitHub stars due to policy enforcement and cleanup
([HTTPie](https://httpie.io/blog/stardust)). The incident highlighted how much credibility in open
source is tied to platform metrics. I read it as a warning that reputation can be algorithmic
collateral damage.

## evidence stack
- A policy or cleanup event wiped out a visible reputation signal overnight.
- Stars are treated as social proof for users, hiring, and fundraising.
- The team had no direct control over the metric, only the story around it.

## risk surface
- Projects with fewer resources can look stagnant after a metric shock.
- Community trust weakens when core signals are unstable.
- Platforms gain subtle power over narrative and momentum.

## decision boundary
If open-source communities standardize on portable reputation signals, I will care less about
platform metrics. Until then, I assume star counts can distort decision-making.

## my take
Stars are a weak proxy for trust. I want to see maintainers invest in signals they can actually
control.

## ending questions
What metric would I trust more than stars when evaluating an open-source project?
