When https explained with carrier pigeons hit, the obvious story was the headline. The less obvious story is the boundary it moves. I’m using the source as a reference point, not a full explanation ([source](https://baida.dev/articles/https-explained-with-carrier-pigeons)).

## set up
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[LLMs]] and [[Compute Bottlenecks]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## observables
- The first order win is clarity; the second order cost is optionality.
- The path to adopt https explained with carrier pigeons looks smooth on paper but assumes alignment that rarely exists.
- What looks like a surface change is actually a control move.

## how it cascades
constraint tightens -> teams standardize -> defaults calcify
policy shift -> procurement changes -> roadmap narrows
surface change -> tooling adapts -> behavior hardens

## duration
Short term, this looks like a capability win. Mid term, it becomes a budgeting and compliance question. Long term, the dominant path is whichever reduces coordination cost.

## my take
I’m leaning toward treating this as structural. Build for the default that’s forming, but keep an exit path.
