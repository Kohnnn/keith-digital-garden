# hyundai supply chain child labor probe

This reads like a supply‑chain governance test. My read is that compliance is now a brand risk, not a back‑office issue.

## scene cut
Reuters reported Hyundai investigating child labor in its U.S. supply chain ([source](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-korean-auto-giant-hyundai-investigating-child-labor-its-us-supply-2022-10-19/)). The story shows how deep supplier layers create blind spots.

## signal braid
- Supplier oversight is a reputational risk.
- Compliance failures travel faster than fixes.
- Labor conditions are now a consumer narrative.
- The governance tension aligns with [[Platform Accountability Cluster]].

## contrast seam
default read: isolated violation / counter read: systemic oversight gap.

## link hop
This links to [[Supply Chains as Policy]] and [[Platform Accountability Cluster]] and [[Port Congestion Squeeze]].

## my take
I think the only durable fix is deeper visibility into tier‑2 and tier‑3 suppliers. If brands do not own that map, they own the consequences anyway.

## ending questions
How far down the supplier stack should accountability extend?
