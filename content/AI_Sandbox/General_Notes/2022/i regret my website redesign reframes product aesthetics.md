# i regret my website redesign reframes product aesthetics

A founder documented how a website redesign reduced conversions and clarity
([TinyPilot](https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot-redesign/)). The essay reframed design as a communication
system, not just visual polish. I read it as a warning that aesthetic upgrades can erase product
truth.

## evidence stack
- The redesign improved visual cohesion but hurt conversion, showing that clarity beats aesthetics.
- Messaging drifted as the design evolved, which diluted the product promise.
- The founder reversed parts of the redesign, proving that iteration should include rollback paths.

## signal vs noise
- Signal: design changes are strategic decisions about message hierarchy.
- Signal: conversion is a proxy for comprehension, not just persuasion.
- Noise: chasing trends without testing whether the core promise is visible.

## time horizon
Short term, redesigns can create temporary confusion in returning users. Mid term, the lesson is to
treat design work as hypothesis testing. Long term, the winning teams build design systems that
protect clarity even as aesthetics evolve.

## my take
I treat redesigns as high-risk changes unless the message hierarchy is explicit and testable. Pretty
interfaces are easy; truthful ones are hard.

## ending questions
What single sentence must remain true after any redesign?
