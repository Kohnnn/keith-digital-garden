# inflation hits 9.1 percent

This print felt like a ceiling test for both policy patience and consumer resilience. My read is that it locked in the rate path narrative.

## scene cut
CPI inflation rose 9.1% in June, higher than expected, underscoring broad price pressure ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/13/inflation-rose-9point1percent-in-june-even-more-than-expected-as-price-pressures-intensify.html)). The headline turned into a policy anchor.

## signal braid
- Inflation is now a dominant macro narrative.
- Pricing pressure spreads beyond energy.
- Diesel and distillate tightness kept CPI stubborn, just like [[diesel inventories slip to crisis lows in us]].
- Rate path expectations tighten quickly.
- The pulse echoes [[Inflation Prints 6.8]].
  
## link hop
This links to [[Inflation Prints 6.8]], [[Europe's Gas Shock]], [[Labor Shortage and the Quit Wave]], [[diesel inventories slip to crisis lows in us]], and [[g7 price cap gambit targets russian revenue]].

## mini ledger
- cost: real income compression.
- benefit: policy urgency and clarity.
- unknown: how fast inflation cools after hikes.

## my take
I think the biggest risk is lag. Policy moves after prices, and consumers feel the gap first.

## ending questions
What signal would confirm inflation is structurally rolling over?
