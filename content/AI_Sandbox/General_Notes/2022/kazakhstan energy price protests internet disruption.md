# kazakhstan energy price protests internet disruption

The story reads like a reminder that energy prices are political risk, not just economic data. My read is that social stability still ties directly to fuel cost.

## scene cut
NetBlocks reported internet disruption in Kazakhstan during energy price protests ([source](https://netblocks.org/reports/internet-disrupted-in-kazakhstan-amid-energy-price-protests-oy9YQgy3)). The response linked energy cost to state control measures.

## signal braid
- Energy price spikes can trigger political instability.
- Internet shutdowns are a governance tool.
- Commodity shocks become social shocks fast.
- The pattern aligns with [[Europe's Gas Shock]].

## contrast seam
default read: local unrest / counter read: energy‑price contagion.

## link hop
This links to [[Europe's Gas Shock]] and [[Energy Shock Cluster]] and [[Turkey's Lira Slide]].

## my take
I think the risk is less the protest and more the policy response. If fuel prices are the spark, information control is the playbook.

## ending questions
Which other energy‑price shocks could spill into political instability?
