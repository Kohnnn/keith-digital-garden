# redirects are soft power on the web

<div class="inline-ref">
  <span class="inline-note">ref</span> <a href="https://garrit.xyz/posts/2022-11-24-smart-move-google">https://garrit.xyz/posts/2022-11-24-smart-move-google</a>
</div>

Google began redirecting maps.google.com to google.com/maps, a tiny move that quietly rewires muscle memory ([source](https://garrit.xyz/posts/2022-11-24-smart-move-google)). I read it as soft power: control the default, shape the path, never touch the UI.

## context + claim
Redirects are not just plumbing; they are governance. My claim: the web's most durable power move is to change the URL people type, not the page they see.

## causal chain
Redirect -> habit rewiring -> attention capture, because the user's path becomes a platform decision.
Habit rewiring -> discovery bias -> market share drift, even when the product is unchanged.

## signal vs noise
- Signal: default paths change without public debate.
- Signal: navigation becomes a policy surface.
- Noise: UX chatter that ignores URL-level control.

## my take
I treat redirects as a strategic layer. If you own the path, you often own the outcome.

<div class="note-micro">
  <span class="inline-note">default drift</span>
  <span class="inline-note">navigation bias</span>
</div>

## ending questions
Which other defaults quietly decide user paths?
