# maps.google.com redirects

## scene cut
Google began redirecting maps.google.com to google.com/maps, a small change that shifts user muscle memory ([source](https://garrit.xyz/posts/2022-11-24-smart-move-google)). The tweak shows how defaults control flow.

## signal braid
- Defaults are a quiet form of governance.
- URL control shapes navigation behavior.
- Platform layers change without visible notices.
- The trust effect aligns with [[Google Search Is Dying]].

## single-line take
Small redirects can reshape habits at scale.

## link hop
This connects to [[Google Search Is Dying]] and [[State of HTTP in 2022]] and [[Trust in Platforms]].

## open loop
Which other defaults quietly decide user paths?
