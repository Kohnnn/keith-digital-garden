# mcmaster best ecommerce site

## scene cut
An essay praised McMaster-Carr as the best ecommerce site for its speed and clarity ([source](https://www.bedelstein.com/post/mcmaster-carr)). It reframed ecommerce UX as operational excellence.

## signal braid
- Catalog clarity can beat marketing polish.
- Reliability becomes a product moat.
- UX can encode operational maturity.
- The lesson connects to [[I Regret My Website Redesign]].

## single-line take
Operational excellence is the most persuasive UX.

## link hop
This links to [[I Regret My Website Redesign]] and [[State of HTTP in 2022]] and [[Platform Accountability Cluster]].

## open loop
Which ecommerce patterns feel fast because the ops are fast?
