# mechanical watch

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

mechanical watch is a pressure test for how this stack behaves in the real world ([source](https://ciechanow.ski/mechanical-watch/)). I read it less as a headline and more as a constraint reveal. The interesting part is what it forces teams to stop pretending about.

## context + claim
mechanical watch shifts the center of gravity toward a new default. My claim is simple: this is a habit-forming change, not a one-off event. If teams internalize the behavior, the market follows.

## signal vs noise
- Signal: behavior that persists without marketing support.
- Signal: policy or tooling that narrows future choices.
- Noise: impressive demos without a maintenance story.

## risk surface
- The promise outruns operational reality.
- Costs shift from build to maintenance without warning.
- The narrative locks in before the evidence matures.

## my take
I am leaning cautious: treat the change as real, but do not calcify it until the operational story holds.

## ending questions
What would make this feel durable instead of episodic?
