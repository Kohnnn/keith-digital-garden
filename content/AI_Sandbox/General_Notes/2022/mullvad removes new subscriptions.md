# mullvad removes new subscriptions

## scene cut
Mullvad removed the option to create new subscriptions, citing fraud and abuse concerns ([source](https://mullvad.net/en/blog/2022/6/20/were-removing-the-option-to-create-new-subscriptions/)). The move treated growth as a security tradeoff.

## signal braid
- Payment models can expand attack surface.
- Privacy tools are sensitive to fraud pressure.
- Business model changes can be security controls.
- The trust posture aligns with [[Storj Removes Warrant Canary]].

## single-line take
Sometimes the safest growth plan is to stop growing.

## link hop
This links to [[Storj Removes Warrant Canary]] and [[Surveillance Normalized]] and [[Trust in Platforms]].

## open loop
Which business features quietly increase security risk the most?

## updates
- 2025-02-21: Seed draft from 2022 backfill. Pending manual review.
