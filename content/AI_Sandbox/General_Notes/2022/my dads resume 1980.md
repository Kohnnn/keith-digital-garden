# my dads resume 1980

## scene cut
A shared resume from 1980 highlighted how skill language and career framing have shifted ([source](https://github.com/runvnc/dadsresume)). It is a small artifact that shows labor culture changing.

## signal braid
- Skill language evolves with industry norms.
- Career stories are shaped by available vocabulary.
- Documentation style reflects power dynamics.
- The labor thread links to [[Labor Shortage and the Quit Wave]].

## single-line take
Career language is a mirror of the economy it serves.

## link hop
This connects to [[Labor Shortage and the Quit Wave]] and [[Remote Work Normalizes]] and [[Work Without a Center]].

## open loop
What skills today will look strange in forty years?

## updates
- 2025-02-26: Seed draft from 2022 backfill. Pending manual review.
