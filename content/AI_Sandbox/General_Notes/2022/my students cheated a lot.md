# my students cheated a lot

The essay hit me because it frames cheating as a systems outcome, not a character flaw. I read it as an incentive design failure more than a discipline problem.

## scene cut
A professor documented rampant cheating and the structural incentives that made it rational ([source](https://crumplab.com/articles/blog/post_994_5_26_22_cheating/index.html)). The piece reads like a postmortem on assessment design.

## signal braid
- Incentive design drives behavior faster than moral appeals.
- Remote learning amplified weak enforcement paths.
- Trust becomes a policy variable when outcomes are high-stakes.
- The education pressure aligns with [[School Closures and Learning Loss]].

## contrast seam
default read: bad students / counter read: bad systems.

## mini ledger
- cost: eroded trust in evaluation.
- benefit: forced redesign of assessment methods.
- unknown: how long the credibility gap persists.

## my take
I think the right fix is structural: reduce single-point exams, increase iterative work, and make incentives explicit. If the system rewards shortcuts, it will get shortcuts.

## ending questions
What assessment designs still work when incentives are hostile?
