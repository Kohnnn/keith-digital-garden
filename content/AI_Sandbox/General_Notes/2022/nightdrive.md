# nightdrive

## scene cut
A personal essay about a late-night drive used motion and quiet to anchor memory ([source](https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/nightdrive.html)). It reads like a reminder that context shapes what we keep.

## signal braid
- Memory is tied to environment, not just events.
- Stillness can be a narrative device.
- The pacing aligns with [[Surviving Disillusionment]].
- Quiet stories can carry strong signals.

## single-line take
Some memories are built from the space between events.

## link hop
This links to [[Surviving Disillusionment]] and [[Work Without a Center]] and [[Markets of Narrative]].

## open loop
What kinds of environments make memory stickiest?
