# physical buttons outperform touchscreens

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

## scene cut
A car test reported that physical buttons were safer and more usable than touchscreens for key functions ([source](https://www.vibilagare.se/nyheter/physical-buttons-outperform-touchscreens-new-cars-test-finds)). It reframed UI as a safety system, not just a style choice.

## signal braid
- Safety outcomes are tied to interface choices.
- Touchscreen-only design can increase cognitive load.
- Industrial design has operational risk.
- The usability lesson echoes [[I Regret My Website Redesign]].

## single-line take
Design decisions are safety decisions when attention is scarce.

## link hop
This connects to [[I Regret My Website Redesign]] and [[Framework Laptop Upgrade]] and [[Platform Accountability Cluster]].

## open loop
Which other everyday interfaces would improve with physical controls?
