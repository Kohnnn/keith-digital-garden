# pockit modular computer tests tiny form factor ambition

Pockit showed a tiny modular computer designed for flexible edge and mobile use
([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3F9OtH2Xx4)). The design sits between a dev kit and a
consumer device, which makes it a useful experiment in form factor economics. I read it as a probe
for how small modular computing can get before usability breaks.

## evidence stack
- The modular approach suggests a desire to separate compute, battery, and interface concerns.
- The tiny form factor emphasizes portability, but also limits thermal and I/O headroom.
- The pitch targets builders, which keeps expectations about polish lower but raises expectations
  about extensibility.

## constraint map
- Battery density limits sustained performance in pocket-sized devices.
- Thermal constraints force conservative clocks and throttling.
- Ecosystem support is thin unless a larger platform adopts the form factor.

## time horizon
Short term, this is a developer curiosity and a prototyping tool. Mid term, it becomes relevant if
edge deployments value modularity more than raw performance. Long term, it tests whether modular
computing can win in the ultra-mobile tier.

## my take
I like the ambition, but I want to see real workflows, not just demos. Form factor innovation dies
without a repeatable use case.

## ending questions
What real-world task would justify carrying a modular micro-computer every day?
