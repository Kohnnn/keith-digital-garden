Pockit showed a tiny modular computer designed for flexible edge and mobile use
([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3F9OtH2Xx4)). The shape is seductive, but physics is
still the gatekeeper. I read it as a stress test: how small can we go before workflows collapse?

## context + claim
The dream is pocketable compute with swap‑able parts. My claim: the real constraint is not modularity,
it is energy density and thermal headroom. Until those shift, the category remains a prototyping
curiosity, not a daily driver.

## constraint map
- Battery density limits sustained performance in pocket-sized devices.
- Thermal constraints force conservative clocks and throttling.
- I/O and screen tradeoffs turn into workflow friction fast.

## decision boundary
If someone ships a repeatable workflow where the device saves real time per day, I will upgrade this
from curiosity to category. If not, it stays a demo that never crosses the adoption chasm.

## my take
I like the ambition, but I want to see a job that only this form factor can do. Without that, it is
a beautiful dead end.

## ending questions
What real-world task would justify carrying a modular micro-computer every day?
