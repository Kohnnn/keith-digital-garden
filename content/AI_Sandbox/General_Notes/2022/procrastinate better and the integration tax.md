# procrastinate better and the integration tax

The headline makes it feel settled. It isn’t. procrastinate better is moving the line on what people accept as normal, and that is the part I care about ([source](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/07/procrastinate-better/492407/)).

## set up
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[Model Behavior]] and [[Compute Bottlenecks]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## clues
- What looks like a surface change is actually a control move.
- The way procrastinate better is framed compresses complexity into a single promise.
- The first order win is clarity; the second order cost is optionality.

## keep / ignore
- Noise: demos and commentary overstate production readiness.
- Signal: procurement and compliance are quietly shaping the outcome.
- Signal: the rollout path is designed for institutional buyers.
- Noise: early excitement won’t survive the next budget cycle.

## what breaks first
- The smallest edge case in procrastinate better becomes the largest reputational risk.
- procrastinate better amplifies model brittleness faster than the value it returns.
- Governance drift turns tactical choices around procrastinate better into strategic liabilities.

## my take
My stance is pragmatic: assume the shift is real, yet delay lock in until the operational story settles.
