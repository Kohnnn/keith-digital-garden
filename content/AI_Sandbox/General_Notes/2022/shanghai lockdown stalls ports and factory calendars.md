# shanghai lockdown stalls ports and factory calendars

Shanghai's COVID lockdown halted factories and slowed the world's busiest port, forcing exporters to warehouse goods and blank sailings to pile up ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/18/shanghai-covid-lockdown-further-strains-us-supply-chain.html)). Zero-COVID became a global manufacturing constraint.

## scene cut
Truck permits were restricted, so even when ships were ready the containers couldn't leave warehouses. Tesla, Apple suppliers, and auto parts makers all paused output. The queue at Yangshan port lengthened as inbound vessels idled offshore.

## signal braid
- This is an upstream hit to the stress already present in [[supply chain issues killing synth companies]].
- Companies like Apple accelerated diversification, building off moves recorded in [[apple shifts iphone production to india]].
- Freight forwarders warned of a shipping surge once the city reopened, guaranteeing whiplash for U.S. ports later in the summer.
- Zero-COVID policy uncertainty made production planning impossible beyond a few weeks.

## risk surface
- Inventory buildups in China translate to shortages abroad once shipping resumes.
- Logistics teams burn cash carrying extra stock to buffer against future lockdowns.
- Inflation remains sticky because supply-side relief keeps getting delayed.

## link hop
This note connects to downstream logistics flare-ups such as [[diesel inventories slip to crisis lows in us]] and travel chaos in [[Southwest Airlines Meltdown]].

## my take
Any strategy that depends on single-city mega hubs is fragile. Shanghai reminded me to map supplier geography with a pandemic lens, not just a cost lens.

## ending questions
How much dual-sourcing would it take for hardware teams to treat another Shanghai lockdown as a manageable nuisance instead of a crisis?
