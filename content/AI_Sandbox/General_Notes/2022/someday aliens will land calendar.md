# someday aliens will land calendar

## scene cut
A thread joked that any visitors would be confused by the patchwork logic of our calendar system ([source](https://twitter.com/foone/status/1572260363764400129)). It’s a playful reminder that standards can be irrational and sticky.

## signal braid
- Legacy systems persist because coordination is hard.
- Standards survive despite inefficiency.
- Timekeeping is infrastructure, not preference.
- The theme connects to [[US Senate Votes Daylight Saving Permanent]].

## single-line take
Standards endure because coordination costs outweigh elegance.

## link hop
This links to [[US Senate Votes Daylight Saving Permanent]] and [[Pole Clock]] and [[State of HTTP in 2022]].

## open loop
Which other standards persist mainly because change is too expensive?
