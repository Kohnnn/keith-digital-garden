# someone is pretending to be me

## scene cut
A developer described an impersonation problem that was hard to resolve across platforms ([source](https://connortumbleson.com/2022/09/19/someone-is-pretending-to-be-me/)). The story makes identity defense feel fragile and slow.

## signal braid
- Identity recovery relies on inconsistent platform processes.
- Trust erosion happens fast when impersonation sticks.
- Enforcement delays feel like policy gaps.
- The governance tension matches [[Twitter Suspends Paul Graham Account]].

## single-line take
Identity protection is only as strong as the slowest platform.

## link hop
This links to [[Twitter Suspends Paul Graham Account]] and [[Trust in Platforms]] and [[Platform Accountability Cluster]].

## open loop
What identity recovery path should be standardized across platforms?
