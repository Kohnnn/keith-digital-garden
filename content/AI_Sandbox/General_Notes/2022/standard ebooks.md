# standard ebooks

## scene cut
Standard Ebooks provides carefully formatted public-domain books, emphasizing typography and consistency ([source](https://standardebooks.org/)). It turns open access into a quality craft project.

## signal braid
- Curation increases the value of free content.
- Publishing quality builds trust in open libraries.
- Design choices shape reading behavior.
- The focus aligns with [[OpenBSD Mastery Not in Kindle Store]].

## single-line take
Access is only half the product; presentation is the other half.

## link hop
This links to [[OpenBSD Mastery Not in Kindle Store]] and [[RSS Brain]] and [[Practice Typing by Retyping Novels]].

## open loop
What other public-domain resources need this level of care?
