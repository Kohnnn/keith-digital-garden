# supply chain issues killing synth companies

Small hardware makers felt like the canary in the supply chain. My read is that component scarcity punishes low‑volume innovation first.

## scene cut
A report described how supply chain issues were making it impossible for synth companies to ship new designs ([source](https://www.synthtopia.com/content/2022/07/12/supply-chain-issues-are-killing-synth-companies-and-making-it-impossible-to-ship-new-designs/)). The constraints looked structural, not temporary.

## signal braid
- Low‑volume manufacturing is most exposed to shortages.
- Price spikes hit niche hardware before mass markets.
- Design roadmaps get frozen by parts availability.
- Lockdowns like [[shanghai lockdown stalls ports and factory calendars]] keep the upstream choke early in the cycle.
- The constraint echoes [[Chip Shortage and the Hardware Bottleneck]].

## mini ledger
- cost: stalled innovation cycles.
- benefit: stronger focus on repairability.
- unknown: which suppliers survive the bottleneck.

## link hop
This links to [[Chip Shortage and the Hardware Bottleneck]], [[Port Congestion Squeeze]], [[Supply Chains as Policy]], and [[shanghai lockdown stalls ports and factory calendars]].

## my take
I think this is where policy and industrial planning should care: small makers are early indicators. When they stop shipping, bigger systems are already sick.

## ending questions
Which niche industries will be squeezed out next by component scarcity?
