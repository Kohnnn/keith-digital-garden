# tesla ai day 2022 shows optimus learning curve

Tesla's 2022 AI Day featured a walking Optimus humanoid prototype and updates on Dojo training hardware, aiming to prove the company is more than cars ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-unveils-optimus-robot-prototype-2022-10-01/)). The robot shuffled across stage, wires exposed, while engineers narrated the roadmap.

## scene cut
The demo emphasized cost targets under $20K and reuse of automotive actuators. Tesla also pitched its massive-label autonomy dataset and chip efforts as the backbone for general-purpose robotics.

## signal braid
- It offered a hardware counterpoint to the software breakthroughs from [[chatgpt launch proves conversational ai is ready for consumers]].
- The cautious gait underscored how far the robotics stack must go before it can match the creative leaps seen in [[stable diffusion release makes open source ai art mainstream]].
- Investors were reminded that Tesla burns cash on moonshots parallel to its auto business.
- The company wants to own both data and silicon, not rely on vendors.

## risk surface
- Shipping a reliable humanoid workforce will take years, and hype can outrun physics.
- Regulatory focus on Autopilot spills over into other AI claims.
- Hardware supply chains remain fragile, as highlighted by [[shanghai lockdown stalls ports and factory calendars]].

## link hop
This story pairs nicely with [[nvidia export limits reshape ai hardware race]] because both revolve around who controls compute for frontier AI.

## my take
Optimus is still a lab curiosity, but it signals that Tesla sees general robotics as the logical endpoint of its autonomy stack. Execution, not ambition, will decide if that bet pays off.

## ending questions
What milestone would convince me Optimus can leave the lab—task completion, energy efficiency, or unit economics?
