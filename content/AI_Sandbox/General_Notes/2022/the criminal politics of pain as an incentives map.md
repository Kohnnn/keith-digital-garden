I read the criminal politics of pain as a constraint signal more than novelty. The link is just the anchor; the mechanics are where the leverage is ([source](https://mssinenomineblog.wordpress.com/2022/11/12/the-criminal-politics-of-pain/)).

*see also:* [[LLMs]] · [[Compute Bottlenecks]]
## set up
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[LLMs]] and [[Compute Bottlenecks]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## notes from the surface
- The operational details around the criminal politics of pain matter more than the announcement cadence.
- The way the criminal politics of pain is framed compresses complexity into a single promise.
- The path to adopt the criminal politics of pain looks smooth on paper but assumes alignment that rarely exists.

## signal vs noise
- Signal: the rollout path is designed for institutional buyers.
- Noise: early excitement won’t survive the next budget cycle.
- Noise: demos and commentary overstate production readiness.
- Signal: procurement and compliance are quietly shaping the outcome.

## timing
Short term, this looks like a capability win. Mid term, it becomes a budgeting and compliance question. Long term, the dominant path is whichever reduces coordination cost.

## my take
I’m leaning toward treating this as structural. Build for the default that’s forming, but keep an exit path.
