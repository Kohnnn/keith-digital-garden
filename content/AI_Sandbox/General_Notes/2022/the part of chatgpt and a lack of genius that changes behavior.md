When chatgpt and a lack of genius hit, the obvious story was the headline. The less obvious story is the boundary it moves. I’m using the source as a reference point, not a full explanation ([source](https://wearenotsaved.com/2022/12/31/eschatologist-24-chatgpt-and-a-lack-of-genius/)).

## scene
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[Model Behavior]] and [[Compute Bottlenecks]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## notes from the surface
- The path to adopt chatgpt and a lack of genius looks smooth on paper but assumes alignment that rarely exists.
- The dependency chain around chatgpt and a lack of genius is where risk accumulates, not at the surface.
- The operational details around chatgpt and a lack of genius matter more than the announcement cadence.

## system motion
constraint tightens -> teams standardize -> defaults calcify
policy shift -> procurement changes -> roadmap narrows
surface change -> tooling adapts -> behavior hardens

## exposure map
- Governance drift turns tactical choices around chatgpt and a lack of genius into strategic liabilities.
- chatgpt and a lack of genius amplifies model brittleness faster than the value it returns.
- The smallest edge case in chatgpt and a lack of genius becomes the largest reputational risk.

## my take
I’m leaning toward treating this as structural. Build for the default that’s forming, but keep an exit path.

## ending questions
If the incentives flipped, what would stay sticky?
