# three arrows liquidation exposes leverage maze

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

A British Virgin Islands court ordered Three Arrows Capital to liquidate after the hedge fund defaulted on margin calls tied to Terra, GBTC, and stETH ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/singapore-hedge-fund-three-arrows-ordered-liquidation-sources-2022-06-29/)). The fund's collapse turned a crypto selloff into a full contagion map.

## scene cut
Three Arrows borrowed from every major desk—Genesis, Voyager, BlockFi, FTX—and collateralized the loans with volatile assets. When GBTC and stETH discounts widened, lenders started margin calls that 3AC couldn't meet. The liquidation order meant administrators now control whatever assets were left.

## signal braid
- Liquidators entered a market with rapidly falling token prices, so recovery values will likely be pennies on the dollar.
- This failure was primed by the CeFi freeze captured in [[celsius freezes withdrawals and sparks retail panic]].
- Anchor and Terra positions that imploded in [[terrausd death spiral wipes out anchor trust]] were a key trigger.
- The collapse validated every concern about unregistered offshore hedge funds soliciting U.S. capital without disclosures.

## constraint map
- There is no global resolution framework for crypto hedge funds, so creditors have to fight through BVI courts.
- Lenders collateralized loans with illiquid tokens and locked assets, guaranteeing a slow unwind.
- Retail lenders via Voyager and Celsius became unsecured creditors overnight.

## link hop
This node connects the CeFi freeze domino to later failures such as [[ftx bankruptcy reveals multibillion balance hole]] once Alameda's exposure surfaced.

## my take
The 3AC unwind convinced me to treat every cross-exchange carry trade as correlated risk, because even "market neutral" desks were simply levered to reflexive collateral.

## ending questions
What combination of on-chain transparency and traditional fund admin oversight would have flagged 3AC's exposures before prices cratered?
