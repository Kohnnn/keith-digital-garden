# twitter fined for 2fa phone numbers

## scene cut
The FTC fined Twitter for using 2FA phone numbers for advertising, framing the practice as a privacy violation ([source](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2022/05/twitter-pay-150-million-penalty-allegedly-breaking-its-privacy-promises-again)). The case spotlighted consent drift.

## signal braid
- Security data misuse erodes trust fast.
- Enforcement actions now target product behavior.
- Consent promises are treated as legal commitments.
- The trust gap echoes [[Platform Accountability Cluster]].

## single-line take
Security data cannot be repurposed without breaking the trust contract.

## link hop
This links to [[Platform Accountability Cluster]] and [[Trust in Platforms]] and [[Twitter Accepts Musk Offer]].

## open loop
Which other security features create data that should never be repurposed?
