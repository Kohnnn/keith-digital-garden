# twitter suspends journalists

The episode sharpened the feeling that platform rules were shifting in real time. I read it as a legitimacy test rather than a content dispute.

## scene cut
Reports said Twitter suspended several journalists under new policy rules, triggering backlash ([source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2022/12/15/twitter-journalists-suspended-musk/)). The decision exposed how fast governance norms can move.

## signal braid
- Enforcement volatility erodes user trust.
- Policy shifts are now public narrative events.
- Platform legitimacy depends on consistent rules.
- The pattern echoes [[Twitter Suspends Paul Graham Account]].

## single-line take
The rulebook matters most when it changes quickly.

## my take
I think this kind of volatility pushes journalists and institutions to hedge their dependency. Platform reliance becomes a strategic risk once rules feel unstable.

## ending questions
What governance protections still work when platforms move fast?
