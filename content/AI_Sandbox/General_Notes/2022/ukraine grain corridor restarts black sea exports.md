# ukraine grain corridor restarts black sea exports

Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, and the UN signed a deal in Istanbul to restart grain exports from Odesa, Chornomorsk, and Yuzhny, unlocking millions of tons of wheat and corn stuck since the invasion ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/un-russia-ukraine-sign-deal-restart-grain-export-2022-07-22/)). A joint coordination center now inspects ships.

## scene cut
The agreement creates safe corridors and guarantees demining along specific lanes. Insurance and freight costs remain elevated, but the first convoys started loading within days, signaling to importers that supplies might normalize.

## signal braid
- This is a direct response to the choke point created by [[Russia Invades Ukraine]].
- Food inflation relief would complement the energy-side efforts described in [[g7 price cap gambit targets russian revenue]].
- The corridor depends on trust between militaries actively shooting at each other—a fragile setup.
- Countries in North Africa and the Middle East finally have line-of-sight on shipments before harvest season ends.

## constraint map
- Ships still require inspections in Istanbul, adding time and bureaucracy.
- Any missile strike on the participating ports could void the deal.
- Rail and road alternatives cannot scale fast enough if the corridor shuts again.

## link hop
This sits alongside [[us rail strike averted by tentative labor deal]] because both highlight how transport corridors have become geopolitical bargaining chips.

## my take
Food supply is now negotiated like arms control. I expect every ag trader to price political insurance into bids for years.

## ending questions
Can the corridor survive if insurance lines pull coverage after a single violation, or will governments need to backstop cargo risk directly?
