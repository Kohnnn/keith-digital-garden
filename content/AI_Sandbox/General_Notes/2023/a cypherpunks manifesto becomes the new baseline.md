This looks like a single event, but it behaves like a shift in defaults. The public narrative is clean; the operational tradeoffs are not ([source](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html)).

*see also:* [[Reliability Debt]] · [[Latency Budget]]

## why this matters
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[Reliability Debt]] and [[Latency Budget]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## notes from the surface
- The way a cypherpunk's manifesto is framed compresses complexity into a single promise.
- The dependency chain around a cypherpunk's manifesto is where risk accumulates, not at the surface.
- The first-order win is clarity; the second-order cost is optionality.

## system motion
constraint tightens -> teams standardize -> defaults calcify
policy shift -> procurement changes -> roadmap narrows
surface change -> tooling adapts -> behavior hardens

## timing
Short term, this looks like a capability win. Mid term, it becomes a budgeting and compliance question. Long term, the dominant path is whichever reduces coordination cost.

## my take
I’m leaning toward treating this as structural. Build for the default that’s forming, but keep an exit path.
