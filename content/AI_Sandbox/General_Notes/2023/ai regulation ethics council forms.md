# ai regulation ethics council forms

A flurry of ethics councils across EU, UK, and US indicates policymakers want technical advice before AI bills land ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/ai-ethics-council-2023)).

## scene cut
Councils will gather technologists, ethicists, and industry reps to craft guardrails and have already flagged data provenance and disclosure as priorities.

## evidence stack
- EU and US working groups released overlapping charters.
- Councils call for auditing capabilities resembling [[eu ai act finalizes compliance timeline]].
- Industry insiders are being pulled in to avoid surprises tech-wise, echoing [[openai voice chat rolls to gpt clients]].

## my take
Policymakers are buying time; the ethical discussion delays urgency while also creating pressure for compliance technology standards.

## ending questions
Can these councils stay independent or will they mirror industry positions?
