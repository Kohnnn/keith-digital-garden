# biden ai order pushes federal data sets open

President Biden signed an AI executive order requiring federal agencies to publish structured data sets for model training, plus metadata identifying privacy constraints ([White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/12/06/executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/)).

## scene cut
Agencies must now tag datasets with usage rights, provenance, and data quality scores; agencies have six months to comply and partner with OSTP to review submissions.

## signal braid
- The order complements the EU transparency push in [[eu ai act finalizes compliance timeline]] and reflects the same data-rights infrastructure angle I muse about in [[data rights become ai infrastructure]].
- It also pressures cloud vendors implementing sovereign boundaries as in [[google cloud sovereign ai regions]].
- Federal data publication may add fuel to research balanced against safety, reducing reliance on scraped corpora.

## risk surface
- Agencies might rush releases without quality controls, creating noisy sources.
- Privacy advocates worry metadata might deanonymize sensitive subjects.
- Model builders must now track dozens of new dataset tags to stay compliant.

## my take
Open data from trusted sources is the missing ingredient for responsible AI. I now expect private sectors to treat federal releases like high-grade ingredients rather than just another dataset.

## ending questions
What governance structure ensures agencies keep their datasets updated and well documented?
