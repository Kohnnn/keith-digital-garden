# cyber insurance premiums stay sticky despite claims

*see also:* [[LLMs]] · [[Model Behavior]]

Despite a mild decline in ransomware payouts, underwriters report persistently high loss ratios, so premiums remain elevated and new entrants avoid the market ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/cyber-insurance-prices-range-high-demand-declines-2023-10-31/)).

## scene cut
Carriers point to large-scale breaches (Okta, ForgeRock) that still cost hundreds of millions. The stickiness stems from reinsurance prices that won’t fall until a clear risk reduction trend emerges.

## signal braid
- The insurance view connects to the crypto crime data from [[chainalysis 2023 crypto crime report]] and the Okta supply chain note [[okta breach fallout highlights identity fragility]].
- High premiums push companies to self-insure, ironically raising risk concentration.
- The lack of down cycle in premiums mirrors the slow-moving chip inventory issue from [[chip inventory rebuild keeps fabs patient]].

## risk surface
- Firms lacking coverage now rely on incident response retainers, which may not pay complex ransom demands.
- New regulation could force insurers to hold more capital, leaving even higher prices.

## my take
I now assume cyber insurance is a baseline cost rather than a hedge—budgets must allocate for it regardless of loss experience.

## ending questions
What third-party controls would convince insurers to cut prices again?
