I read epw: electron-phonon physics from first principles as a constraint signal more than novelty. The link is just the anchor; the mechanics are where the leverage is ([source](https://epw-code.org)).

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

## set-up
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[Latency Budget]] and [[Platform Risk]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## evidence stack
- The dependency chain around epw: electron-phonon physics from first principles is where risk accumulates, not at the surface.
- The way epw: electron-phonon physics from first principles is framed compresses complexity into a single promise.
- What looks like a surface change is actually a control move.

## signal braid
- Noise: early excitement won’t survive the next budget cycle.
- Signal: procurement and compliance are quietly shaping the outcome.
- Signal: the rollout path is designed for institutional buyers.
- Noise: demos and commentary overstate production readiness.

## fault lines
- Governance drift turns tactical choices around epw: electron-phonon physics from first principles into strategic liabilities.
- The smallest edge-case in epw: electron-phonon physics from first principles becomes the largest reputational risk.
- epw: electron-phonon physics from first principles amplifies integration debt faster than the value it returns.

## my take
This is a boundary note for me. I’ll track it as a trend, not a one-off.

## ending questions
What would make this default unwind instead of harden?
