# eu ai act finalizes compliance timeline

*see also:* [[LLMs]] · [[Model Behavior]]

Brussels signaled final approval of the AI Act and published the compliance calendar that mandates transparency, watermarking, and risk assessments for high-risk models ([European Commission](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/european-approach-artificial-intelligence)). The move makes Europe the strictest regulatory terrain for AI deployments.

## scene cut
The Act divides systems into unacceptable, high, and limited risks, requiring watermarking or logs for each. Providers must now perform conformity assessments before releasing general-purpose models.

## signal braid
- The timeline now resembles the release cycles I charted in [[gpt-4 release recalibrates hallucination debate]] because each new capability must align with legislation.
- Watermark mandates align with the transparency demands seen in [[lamda sentience debate shows ai framing risk]].
- Startups that planned pan-EU launches now have to add compliance engineers early.
- The law also influences product design for heavy compute players described in [[nvidia export limits reshape ai hardware race]].

## risk surface
- Companies that miss the deadline risk fines of up to 7% of revenue, forcing conservative rollouts.
- U.S. and U.K. firms that ignore EU rules risk losing the continent as a revenue stream.
- Arbitraging the rules (e.g., shipping models outside EU) could create market fragmentation.

## linkage anchor
This note threads into the EU energy/market narratives like [[g7 price cap gambit targets russian revenue]] because regulation now operates on the same cadence as economic sanctions.

## my take
The EU is betting regulation can be preemptive; I now plan product roadmaps around compliance windows rather than just feature deadlines.

## ending questions
Which compliance barrio will show leaks first: watermarking, risk assessment, or documentation?
