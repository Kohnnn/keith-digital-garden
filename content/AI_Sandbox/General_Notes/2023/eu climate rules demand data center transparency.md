# eu climate rules demand data center transparency

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

Brussels requires new datacenters to disclose energy intensity metrics and on-site renewables before permits, pushing hyperscalers to quantify emissions alongside growth ([EU Climate](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_5001)).

## signal braid
- It echoes the renewable momentum highlighted in [[global renewables additions keep pace despite geopolitics]].
- The requirement now links with sovereign AI region planning (see [[google cloud sovereign ai regions]]); data residency decisions now include energy scrutiny.
- Operators must align with the carbon capture/hydrogen experiments from [[korean hydrogen valley partners showcase carbon capture grid]].

## risk surface
- Smaller builds may fail to meet the transparency criteria, halting expansion.
- Public disclosures invite activism and could delay approvals.
- Data centers might pivot to markets with looser rules, shifting geography of compute.

## my take
I treat energy transparency as the new insurance. If I see no intensity numbers, I assume heavy emissions and stay away.

## ending questions
What auditing protocol ensures the disclosed intensity data accurately reflects operations?
