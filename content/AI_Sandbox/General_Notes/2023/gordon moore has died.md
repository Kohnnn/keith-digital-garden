# gordon moore has died

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

gordon moore has died is a pressure test for how this stack behaves in the real world ([source](https://www.moore.org/article-detail?newsUrlName=in-memoriam-gordon-moore-1929-2023)). I read it less as a headline and more as a constraint reveal. The interesting part is what it forces teams to stop pretending about.

## context + claim
gordon moore has died shifts the center of gravity toward a new default. My claim is simple: this is a habit-forming change, not a one-off event. If teams internalize the behavior, the market follows.

## evidence stack
- The visible change is only the surface; the incentive change is the durable part.
- Adoption pressure shows up before the tooling catches up, which creates short-term friction.
- The second-order effects are where I expect real compounding.

## decision boundary
If this lowers operational burden without a quality tradeoff, I treat it as a real shift. If it adds fragility or hidden cost, I treat it as a temporary spike.

## my take
I am leaning cautious: treat the change as real, but do not calcify it until the operational story holds.

## ending questions
