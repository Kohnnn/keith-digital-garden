The headline makes it feel settled. It isn’t. i destroyed the company's db – by anton zaides is moving the line on what people accept as normal, and that is the part I care about ([source](https://zaidesanton.substack.com/p/how-i-destroyed-the-companys-db)).

## scene
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[LLMs]] and [[Compute Bottlenecks]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## what i see

- The operational details around i destroyed the company's db – by anton zaides matter more than the announcement cadence.
- The way i destroyed the company's db – by anton zaides is framed compresses complexity into a single promise.

## the dominoes
surface change -> tooling adapts -> behavior hardens
policy shift -> procurement changes -> roadmap narrows
constraint tightens -> teams standardize -> defaults calcify

## what breaks first
- Governance drift turns tactical choices around i destroyed the company's db – by anton zaides into strategic liabilities.
- i destroyed the company's db – by anton zaides amplifies model brittleness faster than the value it returns.
- The smallest edge-case in i destroyed the company's db – by anton zaides becomes the largest reputational risk.

## my take
I see this as a real signal with a short half-life. Move fast, but don’t calcify.
