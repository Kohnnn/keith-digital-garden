# otc crypto clearing nudge reduces counterparty risk

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

Regulators and exchanges are nudging large OTC desks to clear trades through CCP-like pools, echoing the trust scripts from [[svb collapse rewrites depositor trust]] and [[celsius freezes withdrawals and sparks retail panic]].

## scene cut
New headlines describe voluntary clearing pilots and mandatory reporting for six-month benchmarks, showing how derivatives infra is now part of crypto’s stabilization narrative.

## signal braid
- Mirrors the compliance escalation in [[sec ramps crypto oversight with new policy memo]].
- Feels like the same supply discipline behind [[chainalysis 2023 crypto crime report]] because traced transactions reinforce clearing guards.
- Signals that risk is now structural—not just about price movements but infrastructure reliability.

## my take
Clearing is overdue. Every OTC desk that builds in CCP-style margin is now shareable regulation.
