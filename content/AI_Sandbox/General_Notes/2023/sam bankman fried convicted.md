Sam Bankman-Fried Convicted is a reminder that the smallest shifts in defaults can carry the largest consequences ([source](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/11/02/business/sam-bankman-fried-trial)). The visible change is just the entry point.

## context + claim
sam bankman-fried convicted shifts the center of gravity toward a new default. My claim: this is a habit-forming change, not a one-off event. If teams internalize the behavior, the market follows.

## evidence stack
- The visible change is only the surface; the incentive change is the durable part.
- Adoption pressure shows up before the tooling catches up, which creates short-term friction.
- The second-order effects are where I expect real compounding.

## decision boundary
If this lowers operational burden without a quality tradeoff, I treat it as a real shift. If it adds fragility or hidden cost, I treat it as a temporary spike.

## my take
I am leaning cautious: treat the change as real, but do not calcify it until the operational story holds.
