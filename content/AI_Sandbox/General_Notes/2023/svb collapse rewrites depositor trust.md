# svb collapse rewrites depositor trust

SVB failed in 48 hours after a run triggered by capital losses and noisy depositors, forcing FDIC intervention and a leap to guarantee all deposits without Senate approval ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/svb-failure-what-happened-2023-03-12/)). Startup treasurers now question every promise made by prior relationship banks.

## scene cut
The run began when the bank announced a $1.8B loss from selling Treasuries and a planned apology capital raise. Depositors flew to alternatives, and regulators stepped in before contagion spread to First Republic and others.

## signal braid
- The crisis echoed the speed of [[ftx bankruptcy reveals multibillion balance hole]] but with entirely traditional balance sheets.
- Liquidity behavior now matters more than asset quality for venture-backed firms.
- FDIC's decision to cover all deposits made it clear executives cannot rely on courtroom timing for relief.
- The overheated SVB narrative is now part of the same risk story that made me wary after [[terrausd death spiral wipes out anchor trust]].

## risk surface
- If another regional bank faces similar withdrawals, regulators will have to choose between fiscal guarantees and moral hazard.
- Venture funds may hold portfolio companies to shorter cash blinds, shifting burn-curve math.
- International clients with large USD balances are reassessing where to park funds.

## linkage anchor
This note connects SVB to every crypto/decentralized failure because both revolve around deposit concentration, but it also ties to [[g7 price cap gambit targets russian revenue]] because sovereign guarantees changed market expectations about sanctions-era liquidity.

## my take
SVB taught me that trust lives in speed; no amount of covenant language matters when clients can move money in minutes.

## ending questions
What guardrails would convince founders that their operating deposits are safe without requiring new bailouts?
