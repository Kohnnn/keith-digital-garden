I read a tiny wasp's big brain survival strategy as a constraint signal more than novelty. The link is just the anchor; the mechanics are where the leverage is ([source](https://blogs.dal.ca/openthink/a-tiny-wasps-big-brain-survival-strategy/)).

## ground truth
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[LLMs]] and [[Compute Bottlenecks]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## what i see
- The way a tiny wasp's big brain survival strategy is framed compresses complexity into a single promise.
- The first order win is clarity; the second order cost is optionality.
- The dependency chain around a tiny wasp's big brain survival strategy is where risk accumulates, not at the surface.

## what to watch
- Signal: incentives now favor stability over novelty.
- Noise: early excitement won’t survive the next budget cycle.
- Noise: demos and commentary overstate production readiness.
- Signal: the rollout path is designed for institutional buyers.

## short long
Short term, this looks like a capability win. Mid term, it becomes a budgeting and compliance question. Long term, the dominant path is whichever reduces coordination cost.

## my take
This is a boundary note for me. I’ll track it as a trend, not a one off.

## ending questions
If the incentives flipped, what would stay sticky?
