The headline makes it feel settled. It isn’t. the lure and frustration of the plastic model kit is moving the line on what people accept as normal, and that is the part I care about ([source](https://labloga.blogspot.com/2020/03/the-lure-and-frustration-of-plastic.html)).

## scene
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[LLMs]] and [[Model Behavior]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## clues
- The first order win is clarity; the second order cost is optionality.
- The operational details around the lure and frustration of the plastic model kit matter more than the announcement cadence.
- The path to adopt the lure and frustration of the plastic model kit looks smooth on paper but assumes alignment that rarely exists.

## signal map
- Signal: procurement and compliance are quietly shaping the outcome.
- Signal: incentives now favor stability over novelty.
- Noise: demos and commentary overstate production readiness.
- Signal: the rollout path is designed for institutional buyers.

## tempo
Short term, this looks like a capability win. Mid term, it becomes a budgeting and compliance question. Long term, the dominant path is whichever reduces coordination cost.

## my take
This is a boundary note for me. I’ll track it as a trend, not a one off.

## ending questions
What would make this default unwind instead of harden?
