# ux panic tests prove fragmented timelines

When product teams scramble last-minute usability tests to prove readiness, I see the same fragmentation echoed in [[figma ai autopilot reshapes product rituals]]—bursts of panic rather than steady experimentation.

## scene cut
Teams brought mockups into quick tests, discovered conflicting feedback, and had to rewrite flows overnight, which then caused QA bottlenecks.

## signal braid
- The rush parallels the startup scramble in [[startup layoffs track from spreadsheet middle]]; pressure curtails thoughtful fixes.
- It also mirrors product governance concerns from [[linkedin ai writer adds tone control]] where late adjustments ripple across brand voice.

## my take
Planning pipelines need buffer, otherwise autopilot-like features turn into rumor-cycles and unhappy customers.

## ending questions
What timeline buffer prevents panic-test damage while keeping momentum?
