The headline makes it feel settled. It isn’t. a south american waterway becomes a cocaine superhighway – to europe is moving the line on what people accept as normal, and that is the part I care about ([source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2024/south-america-cocaine-route-europe/)).

*see also:* [[LLMs]] · [[Compute Bottlenecks]]
## scene
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[LLMs]] and [[Compute Bottlenecks]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## observables
- The dependency chain around a south american waterway becomes a cocaine superhighway – to europe is where risk accumulates, not at the surface.
- The path to adopt a south american waterway becomes a cocaine superhighway – to europe looks smooth on paper but assumes alignment that rarely exists.
- The operational details around a south american waterway becomes a cocaine superhighway – to europe matter more than the announcement cadence.

## the dominoes
surface change -> tooling adapts -> behavior hardens
constraint tightens -> teams standardize -> defaults calcify
policy shift -> procurement changes -> roadmap narrows

## duration
Short term, this looks like a capability win. Mid term, it becomes a budgeting and compliance question. Long term, the dominant path is whichever reduces coordination cost.

## my take
This is a boundary note for me. I’ll track it as a trend, not a one off.
