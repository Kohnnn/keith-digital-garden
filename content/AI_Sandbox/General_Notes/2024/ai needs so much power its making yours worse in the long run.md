When ai needs so much power, it's making yours worse hit, the obvious story was the headline. The less obvious story is the boundary it moves. I’m using the source as a reference point, not a full explanation ([source](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-ai-power-home-appliances/)).

*see also:* [[Model Behavior]] · [[LLMs]]
## scene
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[Model Behavior]] and [[LLMs]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## field notes
- What looks like a surface change is actually a control move.
- The dependency chain around ai needs so much power, it's making yours worse is where risk accumulates, not at the surface.
- The way ai needs so much power, it's making yours worse is framed compresses complexity into a single promise.

## what to watch
- Signal: procurement and compliance are quietly shaping the outcome.
- Signal: the rollout path is designed for institutional buyers.
- Signal: incentives now favor stability over novelty.
- Noise: early excitement won’t survive the next budget cycle.

## short long
Short term, this looks like a capability win. Mid term, it becomes a budgeting and compliance question. Long term, the dominant path is whichever reduces coordination cost.

## my take
This is a boundary note for me. I’ll track it as a trend, not a one off.
