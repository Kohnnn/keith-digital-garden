The headline makes it feel settled. It isn’t. coming ai-driven economy will sell your decisions before you take them is moving the line on what people accept as normal, and that is the part I care about ([source](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/coming-ai-driven-economy-will-sell-your-decisions-before-you-take-them-researchers-warn)).

## scene
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[Model Behavior]] and [[Compute Bottlenecks]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## clues
- What looks like a surface change is actually a control move.
- The first order win is clarity; the second order cost is optionality.
- The dependency chain around coming ai-driven economy will sell your decisions before you take them is where risk accumulates, not at the surface.

## signal map
- Noise: demos and commentary overstate production readiness.
- Signal: procurement and compliance are quietly shaping the outcome.
- Signal: incentives now favor stability over novelty.
- Noise: early excitement won’t survive the next budget cycle.

## exposure map
- The smallest edge case in coming ai-driven economy will sell your decisions before you take them becomes the largest reputational risk.
- coming ai-driven economy will sell your decisions before you take them amplifies model brittleness faster than the value it returns.
- Governance drift turns tactical choices around coming ai-driven economy will sell your decisions before you take them into strategic liabilities.

## my take
This is a boundary note for me. I’ll track it as a trend, not a one off.
