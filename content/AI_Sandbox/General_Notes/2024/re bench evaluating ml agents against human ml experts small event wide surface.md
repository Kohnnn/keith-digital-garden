I read re-bench  evaluating ml agents against human ml experts as a constraint signal more than novelty. The link is just the anchor; the mechanics are where the leverage is ([source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15114)).

*see also:* [[Model Behavior]] · [[Compute Bottlenecks]]
## scene
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[Model Behavior]] and [[Compute Bottlenecks]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## field notes
- The first order win is clarity; the second order cost is optionality.
- The path to adopt re-bench  evaluating ml agents against human ml experts looks smooth on paper but assumes alignment that rarely exists.
- What looks like a surface change is actually a control move.

## keep / ignore
- Signal: procurement and compliance are quietly shaping the outcome.
- Signal: the rollout path is designed for institutional buyers.
- Noise: demos and commentary overstate production readiness.
- Noise: early excitement won’t survive the next budget cycle.

## exposure map
- Governance drift turns tactical choices around re-bench  evaluating ml agents against human ml experts into strategic liabilities.
- The smallest edge case in re-bench  evaluating ml agents against human ml experts becomes the largest reputational risk.
- re-bench  evaluating ml agents against human ml experts amplifies model brittleness faster than the value it returns.

## my take
This is a boundary note for me. I’ll track it as a trend, not a one off.
