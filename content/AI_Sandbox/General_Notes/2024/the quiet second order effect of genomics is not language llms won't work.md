When genomics is not language – llms won't work hit, the obvious story was the headline. The less obvious story is the boundary it moves. I’m using the source as a reference point, not a full explanation ([source](https://medium.com/meta-multiomics/genomics-is-not-language-llms-wont-work-e3cd58b53d06)).

*see also:* [[LLMs]] · [[Compute Bottlenecks]]
## scene
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[LLMs]] and [[Compute Bottlenecks]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## notes from the surface
- The way genomics is not language – llms won't work is framed compresses complexity into a single promise.
- What looks like a surface change is actually a control move.
- The dependency chain around genomics is not language – llms won't work is where risk accumulates, not at the surface.

## signal braid
- Noise: demos and commentary overstate production readiness.
- Signal: procurement and compliance are quietly shaping the outcome.
- Signal: incentives now favor stability over novelty.
- Signal: the rollout path is designed for institutional buyers.

## exposure map
- Governance drift turns tactical choices around genomics is not language – llms won't work into strategic liabilities.
- genomics is not language – llms won't work amplifies model brittleness faster than the value it returns.
- The smallest edge case in genomics is not language – llms won't work becomes the largest reputational risk.

## my take
I’m leaning toward treating this as structural. Build for the default that’s forming, but keep an exit path.
