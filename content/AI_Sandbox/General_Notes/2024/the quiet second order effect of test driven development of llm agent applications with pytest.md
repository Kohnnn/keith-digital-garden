When test driven development of llm / agent applications with pytest hit, the obvious story was the headline. The less obvious story is the boundary it moves. I’m using the source as a reference point, not a full explanation ([source](https://blog.dagworks.io/p/test-driven-development-tdd-of-llm)).

*see also:* [[Model Behavior]] · [[Compute Bottlenecks]]
## the seam
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[Model Behavior]] and [[Compute Bottlenecks]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## notes from the surface
- The first order win is clarity; the second order cost is optionality.
- What looks like a surface change is actually a control move.
- The operational details around test driven development of llm / agent applications with pytest matter more than the announcement cadence.

## system motion
constraint tightens -> teams standardize -> defaults calcify
policy shift -> procurement changes -> roadmap narrows
surface change -> tooling adapts -> behavior hardens

## tempo
Short term, this looks like a capability win. Mid term, it becomes a budgeting and compliance question. Long term, the dominant path is whichever reduces coordination cost.

## my take
This is a boundary note for me. I’ll track it as a trend, not a one off.

## ending questions
If the incentives flipped, what would stay sticky?
