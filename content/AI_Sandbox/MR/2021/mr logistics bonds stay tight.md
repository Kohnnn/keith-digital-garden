# mr logistics bonds stay tight

Logistics bond spreads remained tight despite pandemic jitters, reflecting the same confidence that fuel price spikes in [[diesel inventories slip to crisis lows in us]] failed to shake.

## scene cut
Markets treat logistics credit as defensive; spreads only moved a handful of basis points after supply alerts.

## my take
I now view logistics bond spreads as a macro stabilizer indicator.

## ending questions
Will spreads widen if the next supply shock hits unexpectedly?
