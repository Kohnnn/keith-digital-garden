# mr software bonds on watch

Software-sector bonds widened slightly after growth uncertainty returned, echoing the yield sensitivities in [[mr saas multiples climb as macro steadies]].

## scene cut
Investors cite Fed pause plus mixed SaaS guidance, so credit spreads ticked 15 basis points.

## signal braid
- Reinforces the macro connection from [[fed holds and signals pause watch]] and the risk narratives of [[ai risk stories drive market narratives]].
- Links to the Treasury curve movement documented in [[mr treasury curve wiggles recover]].

## my take
The software bond space is the canary for tech sentiment. I watch spreads like CPI prints.

## ending questions
Will software bond spreads tighten if guidance improves?
