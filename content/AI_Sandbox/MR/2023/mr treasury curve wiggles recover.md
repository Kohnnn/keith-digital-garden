# mr treasury curve wiggles recover

The 2s10s Treasury curve steepened from the recent inversion after softer inflation prints, briefly easing recession worries ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/treasury-curve-steepens-inflation-cools-2023-12-20/)).

## scene cut
Yield movements reflected the same macro data the Fed cited in [[fed holds and signals pause watch]], yet dealers still price in cautious growth.

## signal braid
- Matches the SaaS multiple repricing seen in [[mr saas multiples climb as macro steadies]].
- Reinforces market narratives from [[inflation hits 9.1 percent]] and [[goldman sachs trims growth outlook]].

## my take
Even a modest steepening feels like relief. I now treat curve moves as breathers, not directional trades.

## ending questions
Will the steepening stick once January data hits?
