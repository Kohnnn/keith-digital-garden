# how the cia used crypto ag encryption devices to spy on countries for decades

How the CIA used Crypto AG encryption devices to spy on countries for decades surfaced as a high-signal public thread and points to a broader shift in how builders respond to the current cycle ([source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/national-security/cia-crypto-encryption-machines-espionage/)). I see it as a hinge between immediate outcomes and longer-term incentives. The headline is not just the event but the behavior it reveals.

## context + claim
How the CIA used Crypto AG encryption devices to spy on countries for decades sits inside the market narrative for this period and reflects changing risk appetites. My claim: pricing is reacting to regime expectations more than fundamentals.

## time horizon
Short term, headline sensitivity drives volatility. Mid term, capital costs decide who survives. Long term, the winners are the ones that can keep optionality while the cycle resets.

## risk surface
- Over-rotation on the headline could mask second-order costs.
- Early adopters take execution risk while incumbents take narrative risk.
- If incentives misalign, the outcome becomes a short-lived spike instead of a durable shift.

## my take
I treat this as a directional signal, not a definitive answer. The right response is to adjust posture while keeping the option to reverse if the signal fades.
