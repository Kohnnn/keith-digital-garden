# adobe to acquire figma for $20b

adobe to acquire figma for $20b is a pressure test for how this stack behaves in the real world ([source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-15/adobe-is-said-to-near-deal-to-buy-online-design-startup-figma)). I read it less as a headline and more as a constraint reveal. The interesting part is what it forces teams to stop pretending about.

## context + claim
adobe to acquire figma for $20b shifts the center of gravity toward a new default. My claim is simple: this is a habit-forming change, not a one-off event. If teams internalize the behavior, the market follows.

## causal chain
Trigger -> workflow adjustment -> new default, because habits are stickier than roadmaps.
New default -> platform leverage -> narrowing options for smaller teams.

## counter-model
The skeptical read is that this fades as soon as attention moves. That is plausible, but I keep watching whether teams encode it into their routines. Routines are the actual signal.

## my take
I am leaning cautious: treat the change as real, but do not calcify it until the operational story holds.
