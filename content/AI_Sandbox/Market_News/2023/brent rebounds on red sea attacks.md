# brent rebounds on red sea attacks

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

Brent crude rallied toward $95 per barrel after Houthi attacks disrupted tankers near the Red Sea, lifting risk premiums for seaborne oil ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/red-sea-attacks-push-oil-prices-higher-2023-07-13/)). The bump shows geopolitics remains a primary driver of energy costs.

## scene cut
Insurance premiums spiked and some shippers rerouted vessels around the Cape of Good Hope, meaning additional transit days and supply delays.

## signal braid
- Higher oil prices linked directly to inflation narratives in [[inflation hits 9.1 percent]].
- The move echoes vulnerability shown in [[nord stream 1 shutdown cements europe gas crunch]].
- Shipping disruptions also influence airfreight rates tracked in [[global airfreight index rebounds amid e-commerce]].

## my take
Energy markets still trade on the fear of interruptions; the Red Sea is a choke point that resets prices faster than fundamentals.

## ending questions
Do risk premiums like these justify a recalibrated price deck for industrial users?
