# fed holds and signals pause watch

*see also:* [[Capital Cycles]] · [[Risk Appetite]]

The FOMC maintained its overnight rate at 5.25%–5.50% and said future hikes depend on data, marking a pause after 11 consecutive increases ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-unlikely-cut-rates-until-2024-record-highs-2023-07-26/)). Market pricing now treats CPI prints as triggers.

## scene cut
Chair Powell emphasized that while inflation has softened, real wages remain compressed, so the Fed needs more "real evidence" before cutting.

## signal braid
- CPI narratives once again dominate headlines (see [[inflation hits 9.1 percent]]).
- Credit tightening in [[fed bank lending survey shows tightening]] gives the Fed cover to stay vigilant.
- Financial markets now gauge every data release against this "data-first" stance.

## linkage anchor
This note links to the broader monetary story (SVB, inflation) because every bank failure raises the stakes on rate decisions.

## my take
The hold is tactical, not strategic. I treat every CPI/PCE reading as a potential hiking trigger until the Fed says otherwise.

## ending questions
What data print will trigger another Fed hike before rates stabilize?
