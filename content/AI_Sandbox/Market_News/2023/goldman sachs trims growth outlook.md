# goldman sachs trims growth outlook

Goldman Sachs cut its U.S. growth forecast to 0.6% for 2023 due to sticky inflation and consumer caution, warning that corporate margins will come under pressure ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/goldman-sachs-cuts-us-growth-forecast-2023-09-14/)).

## scene cut
The note cited slower capex and hiring freezes in tech, alongside the Fed’s data-dependent pause, as reasons to dial back expectations.

## signal braid
- This ties to [[fed holds and signals pause watch]] because growth confidence is now tied to rate persistence.
- Margin pressures echo the risk story in [[gpt risk stories drive market narratives]] as investors price in smaller earnings beats.
- Tight credit conditions from [[fed bank lending survey shows tightening]] make the revised forecast believable.

## my take
I now expect moderate GDP prints, which means the Fed can stay on hold longer but leave markets jittery.

## ending questions
Will corporate margins prove resilient enough to justify bullish multiples, or are we still in re-rating?
