# mr airfreight prices confirm demand bump

The TAC airfreight index climbed 9% week-over-week as retailers pulled forward holiday inventory, confirming the rebound flagged earlier in [[global airfreight index rebounds amid e-commerce]].

## scene cut
Express rates spiked on Asia-Europe lanes, forcing spot charters and dragging down available belly capacity for passenger routes.

## signal braid
- The spike underscores the macro linkage to inflation and demand signals highlighted in [[inflation hits 9.1 percent]] and [[fed bank lending survey shows tightening]].
- It also ties back to container repricing stories like [[container rates collapse as demand evaporates]] where demand wobbles quickly.

## my take
Airfreight is the first clean indicator of holiday demand. When it jumps, I dial up inventories cautiously rather than betting on a soft landing.

## ending questions
If airfreight keeps rising will corporations lock in long-term charters before rates spike further?
