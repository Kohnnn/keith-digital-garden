# mr oil slides as israel hamas truce extends

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

Brent crude fell below $80 after Israel and Hamas extended their temporary truce, easing fears of a broader regional conflict that could have hit supply routes ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-dips-truce-extends-2023-11-27/)).

## scene cut
Traders unwound war-premium bets, tanker rates eased, and energy equities sold off modestly as the geopolitical risk discount normalized.

## signal braid
- The drop mirrors earlier geopolitical shocks such as [[brent rebounds on red sea attacks]] but in reverse; peace prospects immediately filter into futures curves.
- Lower oil prices relieve inflation pressure noted in [[inflation hits 9.1 percent]].
- Energy investors now watch for renewed sabotage risk, as described in [[g7 price cap gambit targets russian revenue]].

## my take
Oil remains a geopolitical thermometer. Even tentative truces change pricing faster than fundamentals; positioning needs to account for peace as much as war.

## ending questions
Will energy markets now overprice stability and get caught off guard if the truce collapses?
