# mr saas multiples climb as macro steadies

*see also:* [[Capital Cycles]] · [[Risk Appetite]]

SaaS public comps jumped ~5% after soft labor data and cooler CPI expectations signaled rate stability, leading investors to re-rate recurring revenue stocks ([FT](https://www.ft.com/content/saas-multiples-2023)).

## scene cut
The movement followed the same macro story entrenched in [[fed holds and signals pause watch]] and [[goldman sachs trims growth outlook]], but the sector-specific reaction was far sharper.

## signal braid
- The tighter credit narrative from [[fed bank lending survey shows tightening]] gave bulls pause before the print, so the turnaround felt like a risk-premium unwind.
- SaaS firms tied to AI like those noted in [[ai risk stories drive market narratives]] reaped the largest gains.

## my take
When macro data hints at a pause, SaaS investors race to lock in valuations before multiples reset again.

## ending questions
Can SaaS earnings sustain these multiples if macro data reverts?
