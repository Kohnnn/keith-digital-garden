Pricing Money: A beginner's guide to money, bonds, futures and swaps is a pressure test for how this cycle behaves ([source](http://www.jdawiseman.com/books/pricing-money/Pricing_Money_JDAWiseman.html)). I care less about the headline and more about the constraints it reveals. The interesting part is what defaults this makes feel inevitable.

## context + claim
pricing money: a beginner's guide to money, bonds, futures and swaps shifts the center of gravity toward a new default. My claim is simple: this is a habit-forming change, not a one-off event. If teams internalize the behavior, the market follows.

## evidence stack
- The visible change is only the surface; the incentive change is the durable part.
- Adoption pressure shows up before the tooling catches up, which creates short-term friction.
- The second-order effects are where I expect real compounding.

## decision boundary
If this lowers operational burden without a quality tradeoff, I treat it as a real shift. If it adds fragility or hidden cost, I treat it as a temporary spike.

## my take
I am leaning cautious: treat the change as real, but do not calcify it until the operational story holds.

## ending questions
What would make this feel durable instead of episodic?
