# sec ramps crypto oversight with new policy memo

The SEC published a memo clarifying that most crypto brokers must register under the Exchange Act, increasing scrutiny after FTX and Terraform ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/sec-outlines-plan-tighten-crypto-market-oversight-2023-10-18/)). Markets now price additional compliance costs.

## scene cut
The memo emphasizes surveillance, customer disclosures, and proof-of-reserves; it also threatened enforcement when platforms misclassify tokens.

## signal braid
- This mirrors the regulatory theme from [[tornado cash sanctions redraw crypto privacy lines]].
- Continued oversight feeds into investor risk sentiment described in [[gpt risk stories drive market narratives]].
- It reinforces the governance demand seen in [[ai funding shifts toward safety and services]].

## my take
Crypto compliance is now not optional; platforms must behave like banks if they want to survive.

## ending questions
Will the crypto industry treat the SEC as the new referee, or keep pushing jurisdiction shopping?
