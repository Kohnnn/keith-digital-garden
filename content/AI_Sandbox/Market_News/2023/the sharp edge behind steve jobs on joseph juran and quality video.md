This looks like a single event, but it behaves like a shift in defaults. The public narrative is clean; the operational tradeoffs are not ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbkMcvnNq3g)).

*see also:* [[Risk Appetite]] · [[Macro Drift]]
## the pivot
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[Risk Appetite]] and [[Macro Drift]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## what i see
- The dependency chain around steve jobs on joseph juran and quality [video] is where risk accumulates, not at the surface.
- The operational details around steve jobs on joseph juran and quality [video] matter more than the announcement cadence.
- What looks like a surface change is actually a control move.

## causal chain
surface change -> tooling adapts -> behavior hardens
constraint tightens -> teams standardize -> defaults calcify
policy shift -> procurement changes -> roadmap narrows

## risk surface
- Governance drift turns tactical choices around steve jobs on joseph juran and quality [video] into strategic liabilities.
- steve jobs on joseph juran and quality [video] amplifies pricing drift faster than the value it returns.
- The smallest edge case in steve jobs on joseph juran and quality [video] becomes the largest reputational risk.

## my take
I’m leaning toward treating this as structural. Build for the default that’s forming, but keep an exit path.
