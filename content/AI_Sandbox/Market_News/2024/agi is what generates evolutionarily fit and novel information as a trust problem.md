The headline makes it feel settled. It isn’t. agi is what generates evolutionarily fit and novel information is moving the line on what people accept as normal, and that is the part I care about ([source](https://solmaz.io/agi-informational-fitness)).

*see also:* [[Macro Drift]] · [[Risk Appetite]]
## scene
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[Macro Drift]] and [[Risk Appetite]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## field notes
- The first order win is clarity; the second order cost is optionality.
- What looks like a surface change is actually a control move.
- The operational details around agi is what generates evolutionarily fit and novel information matter more than the announcement cadence.

## how it cascades
constraint tightens -> teams standardize -> defaults calcify
policy shift -> procurement changes -> roadmap narrows
surface change -> tooling adapts -> behavior hardens

## risk surface
- agi is what generates evolutionarily fit and novel information amplifies pricing drift faster than the value it returns.
- The smallest edge case in agi is what generates evolutionarily fit and novel information becomes the largest reputational risk.
- Governance drift turns tactical choices around agi is what generates evolutionarily fit and novel information into strategic liabilities.

## my take
My stance is pragmatic: assume the shift is real, yet delay lock in until the operational story settles.

## ending questions
If the incentives flipped, what would stay sticky?
