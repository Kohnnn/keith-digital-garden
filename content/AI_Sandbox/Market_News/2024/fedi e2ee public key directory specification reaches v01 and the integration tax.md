When fedi-e2ee public key directory specification reaches v0.1 hit, the obvious story was the headline. The less obvious story is the boundary it moves. I’m using the source as a reference point, not a full explanation ([source](https://github.com/fedi-e2ee/public-key-directory-specification/releases/tag/v0.1.0)).

## why this matters
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[Macro Drift]] and [[Risk Appetite]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## observables
- What looks like a surface change is actually a control move.
- The way fedi-e2ee public key directory specification reaches v0.1 is framed compresses complexity into a single promise.
- The operational details around fedi-e2ee public key directory specification reaches v0.1 matter more than the announcement cadence.

## what to watch
- Signal: the rollout path is designed for institutional buyers.
- Noise: demos and commentary overstate production readiness.
- Signal: procurement and compliance are quietly shaping the outcome.
- Signal: incentives now favor stability over novelty.

## risk surface
- fedi-e2ee public key directory specification reaches v0.1 amplifies pricing drift faster than the value it returns.
- Governance drift turns tactical choices around fedi-e2ee public key directory specification reaches v0.1 into strategic liabilities.
- The smallest edge case in fedi-e2ee public key directory specification reaches v0.1 becomes the largest reputational risk.

## my take
I’m leaning toward treating this as structural. Build for the default that’s forming, but keep an exit path.
