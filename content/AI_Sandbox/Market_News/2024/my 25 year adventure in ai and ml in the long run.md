# my 25 year adventure in ai and ml in the long run

This looks like a single event, but it behaves like a shift in defaults. The public narrative is clean; the operational tradeoffs are not ([source](https://austinhenley.com/blog/25yearsofai.html)).

*see also:* [[LLMs]] · [[Model Behavior]]
## set up
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[LLMs]] and [[Model Behavior]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## clues
- What looks like a surface change is actually a control move.
- The way my 25-year adventure in ai and ml is framed compresses complexity into a single promise.
- The path to adopt my 25-year adventure in ai and ml looks smooth on paper but assumes alignment that rarely exists.

## system motion
policy shift -> procurement changes -> roadmap narrows
surface change -> tooling adapts -> behavior hardens
constraint tightens -> teams standardize -> defaults calcify

## fault lines
- my 25-year adventure in ai and ml amplifies model brittleness faster than the value it returns.
- Governance drift turns tactical choices around my 25-year adventure in ai and ml into strategic liabilities.
- The smallest edge case in my 25-year adventure in ai and ml becomes the largest reputational risk.

## my take
I’m leaning toward treating this as structural. Build for the default that’s forming, but keep an exit path.
