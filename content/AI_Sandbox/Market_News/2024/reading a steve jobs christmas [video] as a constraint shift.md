The headline makes it feel settled. It isn’t. a steve jobs christmas [video] is moving the line on what people accept as normal, and that is the part I care about ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiMQnKu9aGw)).

*see also:* [[Macro Drift]] · [[Capital Cycles]]
## the seam
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[Macro Drift]] and [[Capital Cycles]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## notes from the surface
- The way a steve jobs christmas [video] is framed compresses complexity into a single promise.
- What looks like a surface change is actually a control move.
- The first order win is clarity; the second order cost is optionality.

## signal map
- Signal: the rollout path is designed for institutional buyers.
- Signal: incentives now favor stability over novelty.
- Noise: early excitement won’t survive the next budget cycle.
- Signal: procurement and compliance are quietly shaping the outcome.

## what breaks first
- Governance drift turns tactical choices around a steve jobs christmas [video] into strategic liabilities.
- The smallest edge case in a steve jobs christmas [video] becomes the largest reputational risk.
- a steve jobs christmas [video] amplifies pricing drift faster than the value it returns.

## my take
I see this as a real signal with a short half life. Move fast, but don’t calcify.
