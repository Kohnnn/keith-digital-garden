# February 2025: Tariff Turbulence Drives US Decline, International Rotation

US equities declined sharply in February 2025 as tariff uncertainty and weakening consumer confidence triggered a broad rotation away from growth stocks toward value and international markets.

## Market Performance: Divergence Widens

**Large caps stumbled while small caps collapsed.** The S&P 500 fell 1.42% (−1.30% with dividends)[1], but the Russell 2000 dropped 5.4%[6], signaling severe stress in smaller, domestically-focused firms. The Magnificent 7 sold off nearly 9%—their worst month since late 2022[3]—yet the S&P 500 remained only 3% below all-time highs, a disconnect revealing [[Rotation Underway]].

Equal-weighted S&P 500 performance (−0.6%)[6] versus cap-weighted (−1.3%)[1] confirms concentration risk: mega-cap tech propped up headline indices while breadth deteriorated. Growth stocks (Russell 1000 Growth) lagged sharply, while large-cap value gained modestly[6].

## International Outperformance: The Real Story

Developed international equities (MSCI EAFE) gained 1.94–3.29% in February and 7.3% year-to-date[1][4], outpacing US returns. Eurozone and UK financials and defensive sectors led, suggesting capital flight from US growth uncertainty into safer geographies. This marks a structural shift: the US no longer dominates.

## Consumer Confidence Craters

The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index dropped to 98.3—an eight-month low[5]—reflecting anxiety over tariffs, inflation creeping to 2.5% (up from 2.1% in September)[4], and federal workforce reductions. Corporate earnings remained solid (S&P 500 YTD earnings growth 17.8%)[3], but forward guidance turned cautious. **Earnings strength masks demand weakness.**

## Bonds Rally as Growth Fears Mount

The Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index gained 2.20%, with the 10-year Treasury yield falling to 4.2%[4]. This bond outperformance amid equity weakness signals [[Risk-Off Positioning]]—investors pricing in slower growth and potential Fed rate cuts. Yields fell on economic weakness and risk-off flows, not inflation relief.

## Tariffs: The Elephant in Every Room

Policy uncertainty dominated sentiment. Tariff concerns drove volatility across sectors; consumer discretionary, industrials, and energy underperformed while defensive staples and real estate held ground[4]. The VIX spiked to its highest level since December 2024[7]. Markets await implementation details and economic drag estimates—currently priced as a tail risk, not baseline.

## YTD Bull Broadening (Beneath the Noise)

Despite February's decline, the S&P 500 sits +1.24% YTD[4]. Excluding the Magnificent 7, the market is up 3.2%[1]—a sign the bull market is broadening beyond mega-cap tech. Equal-weighted indices and value factors outperformed, suggesting rotation is real, not panic.

> **ℹ️ Key Risk: Tariff Escalation**
> Trump's "Liberation Day" announcement (March 21, 2025) signals large-scale tariff implementation ahead[7]. Markets have priced in uncertainty but not economic impact. Q1 GDP growth and corporate margin compression are the next flashpoints.

## Questions / Next

- Will tariff implementation trigger a Q1 GDP contraction, or do corporate earnings cushion the blow?
- Does the international outperformance persist, or is it a rotation trap?
- At what VIX level do growth stocks find a floor?
