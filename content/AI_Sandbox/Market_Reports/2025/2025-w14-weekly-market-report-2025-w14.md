# Tariff Turbulence: Bitcoin's W14 Rebound

Trump's tariffs sparked early-week S&P 500 and **Bitcoin** dips, but BTC clawed back ~10% for April's best month, outpacing equities and gold amid de-escalation signals.[1][2]

## Tariff Shockwaves
- **US reciprocal tariffs** hit April 2, targeting deficits with min 10% hikes; China retaliated with 34% on Apr 4, driving sell-offs.[1]
- S&P 500 plunged on 104% China levies and global ripple (47% Vietnam, 20% EU); bonds sold off as cash scramble ensued.[2]
- Exemptions emerged: electronics/semiconductors Apr 11, autos Apr 29—cautious optimism for risk assets.[1]

## Bitcoin Resilience
- Dipped early but rebounded strong; low base + quick recovery beat S&P/gold; dominance rose as alts cooled.[1][2]
- **ETF inflows** steady, no drawdowns; CEX balances at 5-yr lows—classic pre-rally signal.[1]
- Hashrate ATH **1,039 EH/s** bolsters security, correlates with price upside.[2]

## Altcoin Divergence
- **Ethereum** -5%, dominance 5-yr lows; active addresses flat, devs at 2018 levels—stagnant.[1][2]
- **Sui +50%** on Mastercard tie-up + Grayscale fund; memecoins/AI narratives faded, no alt leader.[2]
- Hacks like $330M BTC wallet expose risks, fleeting Monero bump.[1]

> **> OBSERVATION** Bitcoin's institutional tailwinds ([[Bitcoin ETF Flows]]) and hashrate ATH position it to weather macro storms, but alt stagnation signals selective rotation only.[1][2]

> *(Key channels; full list in evidence.)*

## Risks Ahead
- Trade war escalation could shunt flows to gold; Ethereum/alt weakness caps broad rally.[1][3]
- Pragmatic view: De-escalation helps, but tit-for-tat (China to 125%) keeps volatility high—skeptical on quick resolutions.[1][2]

**questions / next**  
- Will electronics exemptions spark sustained risk-on?  
- Sui momentum: Partnership fade or Grayscale catalyst?  
- Track: [[Tariff De-escalation Timeline]], BTC dominance vs ETH metrics.
