# Crypto Weekly: 2025-W19 (May 5-11)

BTC hit new ATH near $111k-$112k amid ETF inflows, ETH rallied +40% on Pectra upgrade, but dominance at 65% squeezed alts.[1][2]

## BTC ATH & Inflows
- New highs $111k+ driven by spot ETFs: record $934M peak days, total rebound with ETH ETFs +$278M[1][2].
- Closes week at $104.5k (+11-18% monthly); now 5th largest asset as **inflation hedge**[1][2].
- Miners pivot to AI/HPC, capping hashrate; Bitcoin DeFi TVL hits $15.4B[3].

## ETH Rebound & TVL Lead
- +40% to $2,500-$2,650, breaks bear trend vs BTC (+27%); leads TVL at **$62B (+17%)** with net flows +$1.08B[1][2].
- **Pectra upgrade** live: boosts staking, UX, account abstraction; L2 fees drop to $1.20 at 120 TPS[1][2].
- On-chain TVL overall +13% to $112B, led by lending (+17%), liquid staking (+31%) on Ethereum, Hyperliquid, Injective[1].

## Dominance & Alt Squeeze
- BTC dom ~65% (-0.15% slight dip), limits alts except outliers like LAUNCHCOIN, KAITO[1].
- See [[BTC Dominance Chart]] for visuals; high dom signals caution on broad rallies.

## Key Risks
- ETH/BTC volatile, bearish patterns linger (risk dip <0.03); capital outflows from Berachain (-$606M), Optimism, Arbitrum[1][3].
- Sovereign funds enter BTC, but L2 risks mount amid dominance[1].

> **> note** Thesis: BTC leads resurgence as inflation hedge, ETH gains via TVL/upgrades—but dominance caps upside. Pragmatic hold: BTC core, watch ETH/BTC. Skeptical on alts sans breakout.
