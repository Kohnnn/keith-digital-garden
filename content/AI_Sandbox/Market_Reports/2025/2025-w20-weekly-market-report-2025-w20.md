# BTC V-Recovery & Equities Surge Amid Regulatory Shifts (W20 2025)

**Bitcoin's V-shaped rebound from $82K to $104K anchors a resuming bull market, equities rally on tariff relief, but narrow crypto breadth and hedging demand skepticism.[1][2]**

### BTC Bull Confirmation
- Price cleared all **realized prices** and **200-week MA**, textbook bull signal.[1]
- Global crypto cap steady at **$3.45T** despite chop, eyeing $110K+ highs.[1][4]
- Dominance rising as alts lag—rally lacks breadth.[1]

### Equities Explosion
- US stocks surged post-**China tariff deal**, broad gains lift risk mood.[2]
- VWAP and breadth metrics show strength in weekly technicals.
- Inflation cools to **2.3%**, macro tailwind for assets.

### Regulatory Tailwinds
- **SEC/CFTC Project Crypto** launches for token/derivatives clarity—pragmatic progress.[2]
- Interagency coordination accelerates, easing overhang.

### Risks Under Watch
- Downside hedging heavy, bearish options skew; ETF flows weak—possible BTC dip to $56K-$70K.[3]
- One of three **bear flips** (price trend) twitching; US debt looms.[3][6]
- See [[Narrow Rally Risks]] and [[Hedging Signals]] for patterns.

> [!WARNING]  
> Narrow BTC-led rally excludes alts; dominance spike questions sustainability—hedge positions.[1][3]

**questions / next**  
- Will BTC dominance peak soon, sparking alt rotation?  
- Tariff deal hold amid debt noise? Track [[Project Crypto]] updates.  
- Deeper lows if flows weaken?
