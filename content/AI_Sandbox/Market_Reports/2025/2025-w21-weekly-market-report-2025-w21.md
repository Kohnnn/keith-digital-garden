# 2025-W21: Tariff Shock and Market Volatility

**US tariffs peaked at 27% effective rate by April—highest in over a century—triggering a historic stock crash before partial moderation to 16.8-18.6% amid negotiations.[1][2][7]**

### Tariff Escalation Timeline
- **Feb-Apr**: Rates surged from 2.5% to 27%; 10% "Liberation Day" universal tariff (Apr 5), reciprocal plan on 60 countries (17-49%, Apr 9), China/HK/Macau to 145% (Apr 9).[1][2][7]
- **May**: China tariffs cut to 30% for 90 days (May 14); steel/aluminum to 50% announced (May 30, eff June 4, UK exempt).[1][3]
- India hit 50% (Aug), autos/parts 25% (USMCA exempt), pharma 100% unless US-made; Canada/Mexico resumed 25%/10% (Mar).[1][2]

### Market Crash Impact
- S&P 500 -4.88% (2nd largest point drop), Nasdaq -5.97% (largest ever); bond selloff, volatility spiked on announcements.[2]
- Job growth slowed to 584k (vs 2M prior), manufacturing jobs declined monthly, bankruptcies highest since 2010.[2]
- Bitcoin signals mixed: new ATH, golden cross talk, but "dubious speculation" and "dump" warnings.[sources]

### Economic Fallout
- Short-run: +1.8% prices ($2,400/hh loss), -0.5pp GDP 2025-26, +0.7pp unemployment by 2026, 505k fewer jobs.[1][3]
- Long-run: GDP -0.4% ($125B/yr loss), mfg +2.1%, construction -3.6%, ag -0.8%; fiscal +$2.2T net 2026-35.[1][3]
- Exports -16.1% from retaliation (China 125% cut to 10% temporarily).[1][2][4]

### Key Signals
- Volatility from policy risk; avg rates 17.7-27% drive inflation pass-through.[keySignals]
- Labor weakening: unemployment rising, growth halved.[keySignals]
- Fiscal windfall $2.2-2.8T, but sectoral imbalances grow.[1][3][keySignals]

> **> NOTE** Thesis holds: tariffs yield fiscal/manufacturing gains at cost of growth, inflation, stability—yet backtracking propped some GDP. Skeptical on sustainability amid retaliation. [[Tariff Reallocation Effects]] [[Policy Risk Premium]]
