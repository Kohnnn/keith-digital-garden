# Bitcoin Cycle Top 2025: Bear into 2026

Bitcoin peaked in Q4 2025 following the historical four-year cycle pattern, initiating a multi-month bear market that extends into 2026 with accumulation opportunity emerging late next year.

## Cycle Peak Confirmed

Bitcoin's 2025 peak aligns with prior cycle tops in 2013, 2017, and 2021[1][2][3]. The timing—approximately 1060 days from the cycle low to peak—matches historical precedent[2]. This is not a correction; it marks the transition from bull to bear phase, similar to mid-2019 digestion periods[2][3].

## The Slow Bleed: Late-Cycle Digestion

Price action has entered a **"slow bleed"** phase characterized by persistent bearish momentum[2][3]. Bitcoin trading below the 50-week moving average confirms bear market structure[2][3]. This is not capitulation—it's the grinding downward pressure typical of macro tightening cycles. Retail apathy and cycle newcomers' inexperience amplify the perception of weakness[2].

## Macro Headwinds: Why Recovery Stalls

High interest rates and restrictive Fed policy continue limiting liquidity for risk assets[1][2][3]. The stock market's resilience at all-time highs delays the monetary stimulus reversal needed to reignite crypto demand[2]. Fed/BOJ policy divergence may trigger additional dips (e.g., December 2025 volatility)[5]. **No meaningful reversal occurs until equities crash hard enough to force aggressive Fed easing**[4].

## Altcoin Weakness & Brief Rallies

Ethereum and Solana may see isolated counter-trend rallies, but these are tactical bounces within a broader downtrend[1]. Bitcoin dominance remains elevated, leaving minimal room for altcoin outperformance[3]. Watch for false breakouts—they're accumulation traps for retail[2].

## Counter-Trend Setup: $100K–$110K Zone

A potential bounce to $100K–$110K is possible if Bitcoin reclaims the 50-week moving average[3]. This would be a **bear-market rally**, not a trend reversal. Use strength to reduce exposure, not add[3].

## Historical Playbook: Late 2026 Accumulation

The optimal entry window opens in late 2026 as the midterm year concludes[3]. Historical pattern: accumulate near cycle lows in the second half of the year, then position for post-halving Q4 strength[3]. This requires patience and dry powder—a discipline most retail traders lack[[Cycle Discipline]].

> **⚠️ Risk Factors**
> 
> Prolonged high rates and Fed balance sheet contraction limit upside potential[1][2]. Reversal requires external shock (stock market crash) to force policy pivot. Current macro environment favors patience over FOMO buying.
