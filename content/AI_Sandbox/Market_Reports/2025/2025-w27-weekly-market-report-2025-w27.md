# BTC ATH Rally: Institutional Surge vs. Whale Warnings (Week 27)

Bitcoin hit new **ATHs above $122K** in 2025-W27, driven by ETF inflows and regulatory wins, but whale flows signal caution[4][1].

## Price Action
- Rally from $107K June close tested $108K-$110K supply, broke to **$122K+ ATH** and $2.4T market cap[1][4].
- Formed bullish **Triangle pattern** targeting $124.5K; reclaimed 20/50/100 **EMAs**[1][3].
- First red weekly candle hints at consolidation after surge[2].

## Institutional Momentum
- **$2.2B** US spot BTC ETF inflows in two days; global AUM tops **$150B**[4].
- 'Crypto Week' laws (Anti-CBDC, CLARITY, GENIUS Acts) fueled clarity and appetite[4].
- Macro tailwind: US **unemployment at 4.1%**[Sources].

## Technicals
- **Support $104K-$106K** holds for upward bias; breakout >$110K eyes $114.5K-$125K[1].
- **RSI 56.38** rising moderately, not overbought[1].

## Altcoin Stirrings
- Alt strength emerging; possible **altcoin season** as BTC dominance slips[4].
- Negative alt-BTC correlation flags volatility risk[2].

## Risks
- Whale-to-exchange flows hit **$45B**, potential selling pressure[2].
- **Coin Days Destroyed** at yearly high: long-term holders distributing[2].

> **⚠️ Key Risks**  
> Whale distribution and red weekly candle suggest pullback to [[Support Bands]] if $104K breaks; stay skeptical of FOMO[2].
