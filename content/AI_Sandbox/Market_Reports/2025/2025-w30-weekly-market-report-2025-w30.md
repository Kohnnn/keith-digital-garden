# W30: Tariff Tightens Amid Labor Resilience

**US economy shows structural strain from trade policy while labor market holds—for now.**

## Trade Deficit Widens on Tariff Shock

The goods and services deficit jumped to **$78.3 billion in July**, up 32.5% from June's $59.1 billion[1]. Imports surged 5.9% to $358.8 billion while exports barely moved (+0.3% to $280.5 billion), a clear sign tariff announcements are pulling forward demand before duties take effect[1]. Year-to-date, the deficit has widened $154.3 billion (30.9%) versus 2024, with imports up 10.9% and exports only 5.5%[1]. This is the tariff effect in real time—firms front-loading inventory, consumers hedging against price increases.

## Labor Market Holding Pattern

Job openings rebounded to 7.8 million in May with unemployment stable at 4.1%[2]. Hires and separations both held steady around 5.5 million and 5.2 million respectively, signaling employers haven't yet overreacted to policy shifts[2]. Healthcare is carrying job gains while broader sectors cool. The labor force itself is contracting, masking underlying weakness—this won't last if tariffs feed into sustained inflation and spending collapses.

## Fed Pricing Gradual Cuts, Markets Pricing Hype

The 2-year yield is leading the curve down by ~50 basis points, embedding expectations for a cut-hold pattern over the next 6–10 Fed meetings[evidence]. Real rates are improving, which is supporting housing recovery as 10-year yields trend toward 6%[evidence]. Mortgage demand is picking up. But this is a narrow window: if tariffs stick and inflation re-accelerates, the Fed's easing cycle could stall or reverse. [[Rate Cuts Risk]]

## Manufacturing & Services in Contraction

ISM indices for both manufacturing and services are in contraction territory—a persistent red flag that contradicts the "resilience" narrative[evidence]. This suggests demand is already cooling beneath the surface, even as headline labor data lags. The gap between what surveys show (weakness) and what employment reports show (stability) is widening.

## Tariff Baseline Firms: 10% Floor, 24–70% Peaks

Trump tariff plans are now concrete: a baseline 10% on 100+ countries with escalated rates (24–70%) for Japan, EU, Cambodia, and others without negotiated deals[evidence]. Market highs are bolstering policy resolve. This is no longer negotiation theater—it's implementation risk. Global GDP growth is forecast to slow to 2.2% in 2025 amid fiscal tightening and cooling labor markets[evidence]. [[Tariff Escalation]]

## Hype Cycle Dynamics in Equities

SPY and broader markets are riding a hype cycle—AI narratives, crypto volatility, and policy-driven swings are driving price action more than fundamentals[evidence]. Selective positioning in housing (real rates improving) and hype-driven assets (where momentum persists) makes sense; broad-market conviction is fragile.

> **Warning: Policy Uncertainty Spike**
> Economic policy uncertainty hit 705.38 in mid-April 2025—the highest level since the pandemic and exceeding Great Recession peaks[2]. While the index dropped by more than half by late June, the environment remains fluid. Firms delay investment and hiring under uncertainty; households cut spending. This is the real tail risk, not the headline numbers.

## Questions / Next

- Does the labor force contraction accelerate if tariffs feed sustained inflation? (Watch July/August jobless claims and participation rate.)
- When does the ISM contraction signal translate to employment weakness?
- Do Fed rate cuts materialize on schedule, or does tariff-driven inflation force a pause?
- Is the housing recovery durable, or a temporary real-rate artifact?
