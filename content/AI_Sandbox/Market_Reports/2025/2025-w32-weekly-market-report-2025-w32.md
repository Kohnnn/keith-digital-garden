# 2025-W32 Crypto Market Report (Aug 4-10)

BTC paused post-ATH while ETH/alts rotated higher amid DeFi surge and ETH institutional flows.[summary]

## BTC: ATH Peak, 6-8% Pullback
- Hit $124k+ early Aug, closed ~$108k-$108.8k on tariff/macro noise.
- Monthly cap dip to $3.87T (-1.77%), but supportive Fed cut odds.
- Public firms hold >1M BTC; equities (S&P/NASDAQ) gained despite vol, gold +33% YTD.[summary]

## ETH: 18% Surge to $4.95k ATH
- Undervalued vs BTC, legislative tailwinds, $3.8B ETF inflows (vs BTC -$749M outflows).
- ETH/BTC rebounding; historical peaks at 0.08 imply $8k if BTC $100k stable.[keySignals]
- AUM +35% growth signals institutional shift.[summary]

## Alts/DeFi: Rotation Confirmed
- Alt cap broke $800B to $1.01T+, signaling bull maturation.
- DeFi TVL $152.75B (YTD surge), oracles +47%, ETH tokens +26%.
- Infrastructure/yield gaining; narrow alt leadership pragmatic bet.[keySignals]

> **>info** ETH ETF preference over BTC pragmatic: $3.8B inflows vs outflows amid rotation. Skeptical of ATH sustainability without broader macro ease.[keySignals]

## Risks: Inflation, Tariffs, Weak Sectors
- Sticky 3.1% core CPI may delay Fed cuts; data-dependent policy.
- Tariff/geopolitics risk global growth.
- Alts narrow: NFTs -11%, privacy -8%.[risks]

> **>note** [[ETH/BTC Ratio]] rebound key; watch vs [[DeFi TVL]] for rotation depth. Thesis holds: maturing bull.[thesis]
