# BTC Cycle Top & ETH Bleed: 2025-W33 Signals

BTC nears **cycle peak** in Q4 2025 at $131k-$154k per post-halving patterns, while ETH bleeds toward $2k amid rising BTC dominance[1][3][2].

## BTC Peak Projection
- Q4 target: **$131,000-$154,000**, aligning with historical cycles but capped by **diminishing returns** vs prior multiples[1][3].
- September pullback to **20-week SMA** expected as healthy reset before final push[[20-Week SMA Note]][1][3].

## ETH Weakness
- Hit ATH August 2025, now **slow decline** ("bleeding down") to ~**$2000** support, underperforming BTC[2].
- Risks regression to June 2025 low at **$2140**[2].

## Market Phase
- BTC entered **bear phase** since Oct 2025—shorter cycle ending in apathy, not euphoria[2].
- **Late-cycle digestion** mirrors mid-2019; rallies tactical, not new bull[[Cycle Digestion Note]][5].

## Altcoin Signals
- Selective momentum (e.g., **Monero** privacy coins), but no broad **alt season**[2].
- **BTC dominance rising**, squeezing alts further[2].

## Key Risks
- Recession crash on job weakness pushes new lows[2].
- No QE aggression caps upside; needs policy shift[2].

> **> THESIS** Pragmatic read: BTC wraps 2023-2025 cycle in Q4 digestion; ETH/alts bleed as dominance climbs. Skeptical of euphoria—watch SMA retest.

**questions / next**  
- Will September SMA hold, or break to new lows?  
- ETH $2k test: bounce or further bleed?  
- Policy catalysts for QE/risk-on?[[Risk Tracker]]
