# BTC Holds $109K in Choppy Red September; Gold at Records

**BTC weathered September 2025 volatility, starting ~$108K-$111K, dipping to $109K support, closing $113K-$114K (+3.95%-5.3%).[1][3][6]**

### Price Action
- **BTC**: Held $109K-$111K **bull market support band** amid deleveraging; early strength to mid-$110Ks faded late-month.[1][4]
- **ETH**: Tested $4K pivot, briefly below during flash crash, stabilized ~$4,119 (-8.15%).[1][4]
- Total cap $3.95T (+2.07%), choppy with $3.45B liquidations.[1][5]

### Macro Backdrop
- Fed cut 25bps to 4-4.25% Sep 17 aided mid-month rally; inflation to 2.9%.[1]
- **Gold** +11-12% to ~$3,871/oz (broke $3,600 records), siphoning safe-haven flows from crypto.[1]
- BTC spot ETFs +$3.51B net (despite outflows); BTC dominance 58.5% (de-risking signal).[1][3]

### Key Signals
- BTC/ETH ETF flows flipped: BTC +$332M, ETH -$135M Sep (mirrors 2024).[3]
- Exchange reserves down (BTC -18.3% YoY, ETH -10.3%); self-custody mixed.[3]
- Q4 liquidity from Fed/ETFs, but gold rivalry competes for capital.[1][3]

> **> NOTE** Seasonal "Red September" held supports—skeptical of quick Q4 moonshot amid [[Gold Rivalry]] and data-dependent Fed.[1][2]

### Risks
- Supports fail → BTC $100K+ downside; ETH below $4K opens lower.[2][4]
- Gold/USD strength, equities caution, budget shutdown noise.[1][3]
- Late deleveraging, ETF outflows persist.[3]

**questions / next**  
- Gold at records: Does [[Safe-Haven Rotation]] cap BTC upside?  
- ETH $4K break? Q4 alt rotation if BTC dom falls.  
- Track $109K BTC, Fed jobs data, ETF flows.
