# Weekly Market Report 2025-W43

Markets entered a **complex rotation phase** with inflation resurging, Bitcoin dominance consolidating, and altcoin sentiment deteriorating—a period demanding careful position reassessment.

## Macro Pressure Points

Inflation climbed to **3.0%**, signaling persistent price pressures that complicate Fed policy assumptions. This backdrop frames all asset allocation decisions for the week, particularly in risk-on positioning.

Palladium surged to **$1,600**, reflecting broader commodity strength amid geopolitical and industrial demand signals. Precious metals are signaling inflation expectations embedded in market pricing.

## Crypto: Dominance & Doubt

**Bitcoin dominance** continued its "final rotation"—a grinding, contested move higher that suggests capital flowing from altcoins into BTC. This isn't explosive; it's methodical and exhausting for alt holders. The [[Bull Market Support Band]] framework indicates structural support remains intact, but conviction is thin.

**Ethereum** faces "dubious speculation" territory. Positioning has become stretched relative to fundamentals, and the alt-to-BTC ratio deterioration reflects risk-off sentiment in the crypto complex. Watch for capitulation or stabilization signals.

## Equity & Sector Watch

Stock market analysis for the week ending October 24 showed mixed signals—growth names under pressure while defensive positioning increased. Ouster Inc (OUST) emerged as a spotlight name, though broader tech sentiment remained cautious.

The market is "getting complex," requiring plain-English translation of cross-asset dynamics rather than surface-level narrative trading.

> **ℹ️ Key Tension**
>
> Inflation resurging while dominance rotations grind higher creates a **bifurcated risk environment**: macro headwinds pressure risk assets, yet BTC structure suggests institutional accumulation. Altcoins absorb the downside; Bitcoin absorbs the conviction.

## Questions / Next

- Does the 3.0% inflation print trigger Fed pivot expectations, or does it reinforce hawkish hold?
- Will Ethereum stabilization occur near current levels, or does the "dubious speculation" label presage deeper retracement?
- Is the Bitcoin dominance rotation a multi-week grind or a final capitulation flush?
