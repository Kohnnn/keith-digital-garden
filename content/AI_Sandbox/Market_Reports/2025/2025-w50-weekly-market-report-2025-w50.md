# BTC 2025 Bruised but Bottoming: Miner Caps & Corp Dips

Bitcoin closed week 50 (Dec 8-14) down ~6% in the $87k-$88k range, after November's brutal ~9% plunge to $80k-$82k lows—first YoY decline since 2023.[1][2][4]

**Price Action**  
- Traded critical $80k-$92.5k range; $78k-$80k break risks $70k-$75k slide, $100k upside on recapture.[1]  
- Volatility >45%, perp basis 3.7-5%; post-November liquidation stabilizing.[2][5]  
- 44% peak-to-trough from Oct $126k highs.[4]

**On-Chain Signals**  
- Miner hash rate -4% (sharpest since Apr 2024), historical bottom indicator.[2]  
- Corps/DATs +42k BTC (largest since Jul 2025) vs $1.09B Dec ETP outflows ($21B cumulative).[2][4]  
- LTH (>5y) diamond hands unmoved; MTH (1-5y) selling; tradable float shrinking 130%.[2][4]  
- See [[Miner Capitulation Patterns]] for historical parallels.

**Macro Tailwinds**  
- Dollar weakness ~7-9%; pro-crypto policy, institutional integration, potential 401(k) inflows.[4]  
- Structurally resilient post-reset; consolidation then 2026 upside thesis holds—skeptical of quick euphoria.[4]

> **>info** Structurally stronger via policy/institutions, but low-volume EOY erratic moves lack liquidity tailwind; institutional redemptions could amplify retail panic.[1][5]

**questions / next**  
- Will $80k hold or trigger cliff? Track hash rate rebound.  
- Corp accumulation pace vs ETP flows? [[ETP Outflow Risks]] key.  
- FOMC/policy noise into year-end?
