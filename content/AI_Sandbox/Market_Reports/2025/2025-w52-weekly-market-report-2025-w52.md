# 2025 Bull Close Sets Earned 2026 Tone

**2025-W52 (Dec 22-28):** Stocks ended strong on earnings growth amid mixed December close; crypto shows holiday froth, metals shine.[1][2]

### Equities: Bullish Cap but Breadth Widens
- **S&P 500** ~0.1% Dec gain, **17-18%** YTD—third straight double-digit year despite geopolitics, tariffs, weak labor.[1][3][5]
- Magnificent 7 less dominant; equal-weight S&P outpaced cap-weight, value > growth, signaling broadening.[4][5][7]
- International crushed US: EAFE +31%, EM +34% on weak USD (-10%).[6][7][8]

### Crypto: Speculation Flags
- **Bitcoin/Ethereum** dubious holiday pumps; dominance rises as altcoins lag.[2]
- Skeptical on rallies—overreliance on hype without fundamentals.[2]

### Metals & Standouts
- **Tesla**, **Silver** hit ATHs, underscoring growth/metals momentum.[2]
- Q3 GDP strength backs 2026 themes across assets.[2]

### 2026 Shift: Earn It
- No more multiple expansion; returns via earnings, execution—not mindset alone.[1][2]
- Volatility ahead: watch fundamentals over speculation.[1][2]

> Altcoin weakness persists; crypto dominance signals caution—avoid FOMO into 2026.[2] See [[Crypto Dominance Cycles]] and [[2026 Fundamentals Thesis]].

**questions / next**  
- Will int'l outperformance hold vs US valuations (22x P/E)?  
- Bitcoin dominance break or fakeout?  
- Track: Q4 earnings, Fed cuts.[1][2]
