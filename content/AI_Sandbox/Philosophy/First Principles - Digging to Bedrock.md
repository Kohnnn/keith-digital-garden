# First Principles - Digging to Bedrock

When I say I want to reason from first principles, I am really saying I am tired of inherited answers. I want to know what I actually believe when I remove the scaffolding of culture, habit, and received wisdom. It sounds heroic, but it is mostly a slow, quiet excavation. I ask a question, then I ask why I believe the answer, then I ask why I trust the source of that answer, and eventually I hit a wall. The wall is the thing I cannot justify without circularity. That is my bedrock. The danger is pretending I do not have any. The danger is calling a preference a principle and then building my life on a soft floor. This is why I keep leaning on [[Epistemology - Thinking From the Floor]]. It is the simplest reminder that every argument stands on something it did not build.

There is an older tradition that treats first principles as the starting points of real knowledge, not as personal opinions. It claims that if we push hard enough, we can find basic truths that are not up for debate. I respect the courage of that move, but I also notice how easy it is to smuggle in assumptions. I can feel it in myself when I say a claim is "obvious" as a way to stop the digging. That is the moment to slow down. The warning light in my head is this: <span class="inline-note">I am calling it a principle because I want it to be</span>. Once I see that, I can decide whether to keep digging or to admit I am making a bet.

> Which foundation in my life is really just a habit I have not tested?

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Bedrock:</strong> Every argument rests on something it cannot prove.</li>
  <li><strong>Humility:</strong> First principles are fragile if I refuse to test them.</li>
  <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> The dig matters more than the label.</li>
  <li><strong>Action:</strong> A principle that never changes my behavior is just a slogan.</li>
  <li><strong>Cost:</strong> The deeper I dig, the more I have to let go.</li>
  <li><strong>Care:</strong> The goal is not to win, but to see.</li>
  <li><strong>Tension:</strong> I want purity.</li>
  <li><strong>Tension:</strong> I need a livable path.</li>
</ul>

I see this when I strip a plan down to why I want it.

Counter-pressure: Digging can become a way to avoid commitment.

Micro-ritual: Ask what must be true for this to work.

I keep this next to [[Socrates - The Question That Bites]] and it leans toward [[Ethics - Prudence is a Muscle]].

I use the method most when the stakes are real. A career choice. A relationship decision. A promise I want to make and keep. I strip the story down to what I cannot give up without losing myself. That is where [[Ethics - Prudence is a Muscle]] becomes practical. Prudence is the art of translating a principle into a choice I can live with. It is slow and a little painful, but it is honest. It also keeps me from pretending that a clever argument is the same thing as a good life.

There is a social cost to this method that I have to own. If I dig too hard, I can become isolated and impatient with people who do not want to dig. That is when I need to remember [[Socrates - The Question That Bites]]. The point is not to dominate a room. The point is to care about truth in a way that still leaves room for a human being on the other side. When I forget that, first principles become a weapon instead of a tool.

I also see how this method can become performative. There is a cool feeling in saying "I think from first principles," but the real test is whether it makes me more honest, not more impressive. If the method makes me less willing to learn from others, then it is not a foundation, it is a costume. The dig is supposed to make me humble, not sealed off.

I also notice how this practice connects to the larger question of meaning. If I keep peeling the onion and never accept a foundation, I end up floating. That is when [[Nietzsche - The Heaviest Question]] creeps back in. The test is not whether I can defend my principles, it is whether I can live them. If the answer is no, then the method is just a performance. If the answer is yes, then the bedrock is doing its job.

## annotations
- Ideology: foundations should be tested, not inherited blindly.
- A principle is real only when it changes how I live.
- The method should create humility, not arrogance.
- Digging exposes what I actually care about.
- If I cannot act on it, it is not bedrock yet.
