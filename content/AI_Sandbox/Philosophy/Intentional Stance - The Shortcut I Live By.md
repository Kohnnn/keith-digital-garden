# Intentional Stance - The Shortcut I Live By

I do this all day without thinking: I look at a person, or a dog, or a messy project, and I assume there is a goal behind the motion. I decide that a coworker wants recognition, that my friend wants comfort, that the dog wants the ball. I might be wrong about the details, but the move itself keeps me alive. It is a shortcut that turns chaos into something I can respond to. I treat the thing in front of me like it has a mind, and suddenly I have a map. That is the intentional stance. It is not a claim about what a mind is made of. It is a way to navigate the world without freezing.

> [!note] Core claim
> The intentional stance is a practical lens, not a metaphysical verdict.

The hard part is noticing how fast I slide from "this stance is useful" to "this is the truth about reality." I can feel it when I call an algorithm "smart" or say "my brain wanted to avoid that." The stance is a tool, but I forget that and I start treating it like a camera. That is where the danger lives. The tool becomes a trap. The small warning that keeps me honest is this: <span class="inline-note">I chose a story because it helped me predict</span>. The prediction can be useful even if the story is not the whole truth.

> Where am I using the stance to avoid learning the real mechanics?

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Shortcut:</strong> The stance lets me predict without full knowledge.</li>
  <li><strong>Calibration:</strong> I should update the story when the prediction fails.</li>
  <li><strong>Humility:</strong> Useful does not mean true in the deepest sense.</li>
  <li><strong>Care:</strong> Treating someone as an agent can be respect, not projection.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> I can assign intentions that were never there.</li>
  <li><strong>Repair:</strong> When the stance fails, I need a deeper model.</li>
  <li><strong>Tension:</strong> I want a story.</li>
  <li><strong>Tension:</strong> I need the mechanics.</li>
</ul>

I see this when I label a coworker lazy after one mistake.

Counter-pressure: I can strip agency from others to feel safe.

Micro-ritual: Replace one assumption with a question.

I keep this next to [[Socrates - The Question That Bites]] and it leans toward [[Artificial Intelligence - The Mirror That Talks Back]].

This shows up in how I talk about myself. I say "I wanted" when it might have been a habit, a reflex, or a mood I did not choose. The stance makes me feel coherent, but it can also smooth out the messy parts of my own mind. That is why [[Epistemology - Thinking From the Floor]] matters here. If I do not check my footing, I will confuse the story of my motives with the truth of my motives. The stance becomes a mirror that flatters me.

It also shows up when I read silence. I assume someone is cold, or distant, or angry, when they might be exhausted. The stance gives me a story, but the story can be wrong. That is why I try to treat the stance as a first draft, not a verdict. Curiosity is the antidote to projection.

It also shapes how I treat technology. If I treat a system like it has goals, I can negotiate with it in my head. That is useful, but it can also make me lazy about how the system actually works. This is where [[Thought Experiments - The Laboratory in My Head]] helps. I can test the stance by imagining what would change if I stripped the system of intention and left only rules. If the prediction still works, the stance is a good tool. If it collapses, I need to update my model.

Finally, the stance touches ethics. If I treat someone as a full agent, I owe them respect and responsibility. If I treat them as a mechanism, I can justify using them. That is a heavy line to cross. It is where [[Ethics - Prudence is a Muscle]] keeps me honest, because prudence forces me to choose the kind of relationship I want to have with the world. The intentional stance is a choice, and choices have moral weight.

## annotations
- Ideology: treat minds as worthy of respect even when I use models.
- A stance is a lens, not a verdict.
- Prediction is not the same thing as truth.
- The stance can be respectful or careless depending on how I use it.
- When the stance breaks, it reveals a deeper model I have to learn.
