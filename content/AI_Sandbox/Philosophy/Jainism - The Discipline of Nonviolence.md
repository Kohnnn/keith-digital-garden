# Jainism - The Discipline of Nonviolence

Jainism feels like a sharp edge of ethics. It takes nonviolence and turns it into a full lifestyle. It is not just "do not hurt people." It is do not harm life in any form, as much as you can avoid it. That is a radical standard. It challenges western moral thought that often treats harm as a necessary tool. Jainism says: start by refusing unnecessary harm, and let that refusal rewire your entire day.

This is the part that keeps tugging at me.

> Nonviolence is a discipline of attention, not a vague feeling.

The part that confronts me is how precise the ethic is. It is not only about what I do, but what I permit, what I consume, and what I ignore. That level of care can feel impossible. The warning I keep close is this: <span class="inline-note">every convenience has a cost in someone else's body</span>. That line keeps me from treating harm as abstract.

> [!question] Reflective question
> Where do I accept small harms because they are convenient?

My mind keeps running to [[Zoroastrianism - The Fire of Choice]] whenever this tightens.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Care:</strong> Nonviolence begins with attention.</li>
  <li><strong>Discipline:</strong> The ethic lives in daily habits, not just ideals.</li>
  <li><strong>Humility:</strong> I cannot be perfectly pure, but I can be honest.</li>
  <li><strong>Tension:</strong> I want comfort.</li>
  <li><strong>Tension:</strong> I need integrity.</li>
  <li><strong>Repair:</strong> When harm is unavoidable, I can choose less.</li>
</ul>

This ethic pushes against western ideology that celebrates domination. It also challenges the western religious idea that intention is enough. Jainism says intention is not enough if the act still harms. That is a hard lesson. It forces me to measure my life by impact, not just by motive.

I also see how this relates to [[Extractivism - The Hunger That Eats the Ground]]. If I treat land as a tool, I will harm it. Jainism refuses that logic. It insists on reverence for life, even when the life is small and quiet. That connects to [[Environmental Philosophy - Land Turned Into a Machine]]. Nonviolence is not only personal, it is ecological.

There is a danger here too. The ethic can become purity theater if I use it to judge others. That is why I keep [[Ethics - Prudence is a Muscle]] nearby. Prudence helps me apply a hard ideal without becoming cruel. It keeps the discipline from turning into pride.

I see this when I choose a slower option because it hurts less. 

Counter-pressure: Nonviolence can become self-righteous if I forget mercy.

Micro-ritual: Once a day, choose the less harmful option even if it is less convenient.

I keep this next to [[Extractivism - The Hunger That Eats the Ground]] and it leans toward [[Environmental Philosophy - Land Turned Into a Machine]].

## annotations
- Ideology: minimizing harm is a core measure of integrity.
- Nonviolence is practice, not posture.
- Purity is not the goal; honesty is.
- The ethic scales from self to world.
