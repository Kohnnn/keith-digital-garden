# Memetics - The Idea That Eats Me

I keep noticing that ideas do not just sit in my head. They spread. They mutate. They compete for space in the same way weeds compete for sunlight. A meme is not just a joke on a screen; it is a unit of cultural transmission, a tiny package of behavior that wants to survive. That survival pressure changes me. It shapes my attention, my language, my sense of what is "normal." This is the part that makes me uneasy. I want to be the author of my life, but the ideas around me want to use me as a host. That is not paranoia. That is ecology, just at the level of culture.

I keep testing this against my day, not just my ideas.

> Memes are not only things I share; they are patterns that shape who I become.

I feel the pressure most when I notice how quickly my language shifts. One week I am talking in a meme tone. The next week I am bored of it and I move on. That is not always bad. It is just evidence that culture has its own momentum. The warning light in me sounds like this: <span class="inline-note">I said it because the idea wanted airtime</span>. That sentence is a little dramatic, but it keeps me awake to the fact that attention is an ecosystem.

> [!question] Reflective question
> Which ideas am I feeding that leave me emptier each time?

This sits in the same neighborhood as [[Yogacara - The Mind That Paints]], even if the mood is different.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Replication:</strong> Ideas survive by being easy to remember and repeat.</li>
  <li><strong>Mutation:</strong> Each retelling changes the shape of the idea.</li>
  <li><strong>Selection:</strong> The culture rewards the ideas that fit the moment.</li>
  <li><strong>Host:</strong> I am a carrier as much as I am a chooser.</li>
  <li><strong>Identity:</strong> Some memes attach to my ego and stay there.</li>
  <li><strong>Agency:</strong> Noticing the pressure gives me room to resist.</li>
  <li><strong>Tension:</strong> I want to fit in.</li>
  <li><strong>Tension:</strong> I need to choose.</li>
</ul>

I see this when a phrase slips out of my mouth and I did not choose it.

Counter-pressure: I can blame memes instead of taking responsibility.

Micro-ritual: Pause before sharing a meme.

I keep this next to [[Abstraction - The Idea That Floats]] and it leans toward [[Communicant - The Ethics of Being Heard]].

This topic makes me return to [[Abstraction - The Idea That Floats]] because memes are abstractions with teeth. They float, but they also bite. They simplify complex realities into small repeatable units. That is powerful, but it can flatten the truth. It is why I want to slow down and ask, "What got lost in the compression?" If the idea cannot survive that question, it might be a meme worth starving.

I also notice how memes compete inside me. One idea says "optimize." Another says "rest." One says "be seen." Another says "stay small." The mix feels like a crowded room. That is why I need practices that let me choose which ideas get a seat at the table. If I do not choose, the loudest meme wins.

Memetics also rewires how I read meaning. A catchy idea can feel like a truth because it is catchy. That is where [[Epistemology - Thinking From the Floor]] helps me. The floor is the contact with reality that a meme often skips. I want the discipline to ask whether the idea works in the real world, not just whether it spreads in the social world.

I keep a small hygiene practice for memes: if I feel the urge to share it immediately, I pause. If it flatters my identity too perfectly, I pause. That pause is my only defense against being used as a carrier. It gives me a second to choose which ideas deserve oxygen.

Finally, memetics makes me think about responsibility. If I share an idea, I am not only expressing myself. I am also releasing a pattern into my community. That is a moral act. It is why [[Ethics - Prudence is a Muscle]] stays nearby. Prudence is the habit of asking whether the thing that spreads will build or break the people who carry it.

## annotations
- Ideology: I am responsible for the ideas I feed and spread.
- Ideas can feel alive because they act alive.
- Spread is not the same as truth.
- Compression is useful but dangerous.
- Agency starts with attention.
