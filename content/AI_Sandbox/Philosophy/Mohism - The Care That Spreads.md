# Mohism - The Care That Spreads

Mohism hits me like a moral cold shower. It says I cannot keep my care in a small circle and pretend I am ethical. If I only love my own, I am practicing a disguised favoritism. Mohism pushes for impartial care, a kind of moral widening that feels almost impossible at first. It also refuses wasteful ritual and empty display. In a western frame, it sounds like a version of utilitarianism with a stricter spine, but it is less about math and more about social peace. The core question is simple: does this action reduce harm in the larger room?

Some days this feels like a promise, other days a warning.

I remember sitting in a crowded train, watching an elderly person sway without a seat. I froze, waiting for someone else to move. Mohism would call that a moral failure. It would not accept my excuse that I was tired. <span class="inline-note">Impartial care is not a feeling, it is a decision to act</span>. That lands hard. It makes my private compassion feel too small. I keep thinking about how this clashes with the western habit of treating moral life as a personal project. Mohism treats it as a social duty that must be visible.

> Whose well-being am I ignoring because they are outside my circle?

I feel the hinge with [[Pyrrhonism - The Peace of Suspension]] most when the stakes are real.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Impartiality:</strong> Care should not be gated by kinship.</li>
  <li><strong>Pragmatism:</strong> Actions are judged by public impact.</li>
  <li><strong>Frugality:</strong> Waste is a moral error.</li>
  <li><strong>Tension:</strong> I want loyalty to my people.</li>
  <li><strong>Tension:</strong> I want fairness beyond my people.</li>
  <li><strong>Peace:</strong> When care spreads, conflict shrinks.</li>
</ul>

Mohism also refuses hollow ceremony. That is a direct pushback against both Confucian ritual and certain western forms of moral performance. It asks for utility: does this help the poor, reduce conflict, strengthen trust? I can feel the attraction and the risk. The attraction is obvious: it keeps me honest. The risk is that a life stripped of beauty can become gray and hard. This is where I keep it near [[Aesthetics - The Price of Beauty]] and [[Confucianism - The Shape of Duty]]. Mohism says beauty is only good if it serves life. Confucianism says beauty can be a form of care. I live in the tension between those two.

There is a political edge here too. Mohism distrusts hierarchy that exists just to maintain privilege. It wants leadership to be measured by outcomes, not inherited status. That is a pressure on the western romance of individual success. Mohism would say merit is not enough; results for the common good matter more. I hear an echo of [[Fair Division - The Blueberry Pie Rule]] because fair systems matter even when no one is watching.

Mohism also expands what I mean by love. It is not just affection or attachment. It is active prevention of harm. In a world of resource scarcity and ecological stress, that feels crucial. If I apply Mohism to the planet, it becomes a form of environmental ethics, and I can see it meeting [[Environmental Philosophy - Land Turned Into a Machine]] with a demand: do not make your comfort someone else’s suffering. That is both obvious and hard.

Another way Mohism presses me is in how I spend time and money. It is suspicious of luxury that does not help anyone. That can feel harsh, but it also feels clarifying. I think about the western habit of treating philanthropy as optional and private. Mohism turns it into a public expectation. It does not let me keep my ethics inside my head. It asks for visible results.

Counter-pressure: Impartial care can flatten intimacy and erase the meaning of special bonds.

Micro-ritual: Do one concrete act today for someone I do not know.

I keep this next to [[Fair Division - The Blueberry Pie Rule]] and it leans toward [[Environmental Philosophy - Land Turned Into a Machine]].
