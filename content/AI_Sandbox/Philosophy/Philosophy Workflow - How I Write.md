# Philosophy Workflow - How I Write

This is the process I follow when I write a philosophy note in my voice. It keeps the tone honest, the structure consistent, and the sources grounded without turning the note into a lecture.

## inputs
- One classic text or book that holds the core tension.
- One essay or blog post that clarifies the same idea in plain language.
- One YouTube transcript that adds a spoken, accessible framing.

## drafting steps
1) Write a one-line tension statement in my own words.
2) Choose 2-3 related notes to link inside the body.
3) Draft 4-6 paragraphs as a brain-dump, no section headers.
4) Add a core claim callout and a reflective question callout.
5) Insert one inline note chip and one long bullet cluster.

## structure checklist
- Frontmatter includes: title, tags, draft, description, created, updated, note_id.
- Body is 800-1200 words with 2+ cross-links.
- Add an annotations section with 3-5 sharp bullets.
- Add a linkage tree block for connections.
- Add references in callout blocks with direct links only.
- End with a trailing # line.

## tone checks
- First person, casual, direct, no academic voice.
- No source names inside the body.
- No quotes longer than a single line.
- Always return to lived examples and small, real actions.
- Add a one-sentence ideology check: what value stance the note defends.
