# global carbon budget 2020 rebound warning

The Global Carbon Project reported that COVID-19 lockdowns cut global CO₂ emissions by ~7% in 2020, yet warned levels would surge back without structural shifts ([Global Carbon Project](https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/index.htm)).

## evidence stack
- Fossil CO₂ emissions: 34.1 Gt (down from 36.7 Gt in 2019).
- Biggest declines in transportation; industry and power plants dipped less.
- Atmospheric CO₂ still hit 412 ppm because the reduction was temporary.

## signal braid
- The data shows lockdowns aren’t climate policy; structural moves like [[global renewables additions keep pace despite geopolitics]] matter more.
- Governments planning stimulus packages should embed green requirements or the rebound erases gains.

## my take
The 2020 carbon dip was the quiet before a louder storm. Only systemic energy changes—not forced shutdowns—bend the curve.

## ending questions
What structural policy can lock in emission reductions without requiring economy-wide shutdowns?
