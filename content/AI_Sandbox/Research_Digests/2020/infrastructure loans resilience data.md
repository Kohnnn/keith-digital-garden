# infrastructure loans resilience data

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

Infrastructure loans with resilience covenants defaulted less amid the 2020 disruptions, reinforcing the risk planning themes in [[slack is a luxury in supply chains]] and [[playbook covid supply shocks data review]].

## signal locus
- Resilience to shocks now a credit factor, much like SaaS credit is in [[mr saas multiples climb as macro steadies]].

## my take
I now demand resilience clauses before closing any facility.
