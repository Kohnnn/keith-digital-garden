# open source ventilator prototypes tackle shortages

As ventilator demand surged, makers and universities released open-source designs like MIT's E-Vent and the University of Minnesota's Coventor, hoping crowd manufacturing could help ([MIT E-Vent](https://emergency-vent.mit.edu/)). The designs highlighted how digital collaboration can jumpstart essential hardware.

## evidence stack
- Designs focused on automating manual resuscitators with off-the-shelf components, cutting lead times.
- Open-source communities shared CAD, control algorithms, and testing protocols publicly.
- Regulatory bodies like the FDA issued emergency use authorizations, demonstrating agile governance.
- This trend mirrors the nimble hardware shown in [[spacex demo-2 proves crew dragon viability]] though at a drastically different scale.

## constraint map
- Only a few prototypes gained GA approvals, so scale remained limited.
- Hospitals needed proven reliability; prototypes were not always ready.
- Supply chains for brazing, filters, and sensors were still constrained.

## my take
The open-source ventilator push shows that when the market stalls, grassroots engineering can temporarily fill the gap—but we need to convert those prototypes into regulated production pipelines.

## ending questions
How do we channel maker momentum into regulated production without sacrificing safety?
