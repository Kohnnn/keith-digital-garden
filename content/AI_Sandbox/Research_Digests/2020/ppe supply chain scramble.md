# ppe supply chain scramble

Hospitals begged for personal protective equipment, yet Global procurement channels were tied to single-source suppliers and Chinese exports, forcing FEMA to wrestle for inventory ([CNBC PPE Shortage](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/18/coronavirus-how-ppe-shortages-hurt-us-health-care-workers.html)). The lack of guardrails meant waves of hoarding and price gouging.

## evidence stack
- Domestic mask production covered less than 1% of demand, so the U.S. invoked the Defense Production Act.
- Export bans from suppliers like China and Malaysia created immediate bottlenecks.
- Hospitals competed with gov agencies, showing that coordination collapsed.
- The scramble echoed the logistic fragility we saw in [[shanghai lockdown stalls ports and factory calendars]].

## constraint map
- Medical-grade materials require specialized suppliers, which take months to ramp.
- Stockpiles were dated, so quality control added friction.
- National procurement offices moved slowly, giving private brokers time to gouge.

## linkage anchor
This note connects back to [[baby formula shortage triggers defense production act]] because markets sure as hell notice when national security gets invoked for consumer goods.

## my take
We treated PPE as a commodity, not a strategic material. The U.S. still lacks a resilient mesh for critical health supplies.

## ending questions
How many more health items will we import before we decide to make them at home?
