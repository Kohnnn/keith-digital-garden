This cluster ties together tax reporting, product restrictions, mining crackdowns, and ETF approvals. The common thread is that regulation moved from background noise into product design.

## signals
- Policy actions began to define product boundaries.
- Compliance costs became a competitive filter.
- Market access depended on regulatory wrappers.
- Narrative legitimacy shifted with policy approval.
- Regulatory timing shaped adoption curves.

## my take
2021 turned crypto into a policy-first market. The technology didn’t change as fast as the regulatory posture did.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Constraint:</strong> Policy set the design space.</li>
  <li><strong>Access:</strong> Wrappers mattered more than purity.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Approval became legitimacy.</li>
  <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Compliance filtered out smaller players.</li>
  <li><strong>Trend:</strong> Regulation is now a product variable.</li>
</ul>
