# Energy Shock Cluster

This cluster connects gas shocks, power rationing, and grid stress into a single theme: energy fragility in a transition era. The common link is price volatility driven by tight supply and policy constraints.

## signals
- Energy price spikes became a macro inflation driver.
- Supply constraints exposed dependency risk.
- Policy choices shaped price volatility.
- Infrastructure resilience lagged demand.
- Energy shocks spilled into broader markets.

## my take
2021 made energy risk a first‑order macro variable. The transition requires stability, but stability is now hard to guarantee.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Energy shocks ripple into everything.</li>
  <li><strong>Policy:</strong> Decisions shape price outcomes fast.</li>
  <li><strong>Supply:</strong> Tightness amplifies volatility.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Energy is now a macro headline.</li>
  <li><strong>Transition:</strong> The bridge is the fragile part.</li>
</ul>
