# Platform Accountability Cluster

<div class="keyword-row">
  <span class="inline-keyword">platform</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">policy</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">trust</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">regulation</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">harm</span>
</div>

This cluster links whistleblower disclosures, app store rulings, and privacy debates into one theme: the platform accountability cycle. The pressure moved from public debate into policy action.

## signals
- Evidence and disclosure accelerated policy response.
- Platforms faced growing governance scrutiny.
- Trust erosion became a business risk.
- Regulation moved from theory to enforcement.
- Platform rules became public policy topics.

## my take
2021 made platform governance a mainstream issue. The long-term shift is that policy pressure is now structural, not episodic.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Pressure:</strong> Disclosure drives policy speed.</li>
  <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Accountability is a market variable.</li>
  <li><strong>Policy:</strong> Oversight is no longer optional.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Governance debates now shape product design.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Trust loss has real cost.</li>
</ul>
