This cluster captured how ransomware moved from nuisance to systemic risk. Attacks on fuel, food, and managed services exposed fragile dependencies. The story was about scale and leverage, not just malware.

## signals
- Critical infrastructure became a prime target.
- Supply chains magnified single breaches.
- Recovery costs rivaled prevention costs.
- Policy responses accelerated under public pressure.
- Incident transparency became part of trust.

## my take
Ransomware in 2021 was a reminder that cyber risk is economic risk. The trend line points toward more regulation and more baseline requirements.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Leverage:</strong> Attackers target the most connected nodes.</li>
  <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Recovery is the real bill.</li>
  <li><strong>Policy:</strong> Public disruption forces policy response.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Cyber risk is now macro risk.</li>
  <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Transparency is part of recovery.</li>
</ul>
