This cluster ties Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic, and Inspiration4 into a single theme: private space as a market, not a spectacle. The shift is from demonstration to cadence.

## signals
- Commercial crews became a recurring story, not a one-off.
- Trust and safety narratives now shape market adoption.
- Capital followed visible milestones.
- Competition accelerated launch cadence.
- Public attention became a funding lever.

## my take
2021 marked the transition from experimental to commercial. The next test is whether cadence and profitability can match the attention.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Cadence:</strong> Frequency matters more than single wins.</li>
  <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Safety drives demand.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Visibility creates capital access.</li>
  <li><strong>Market:</strong> Competition builds the ecosystem.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Momentum depends on avoiding failures.</li>
</ul>
