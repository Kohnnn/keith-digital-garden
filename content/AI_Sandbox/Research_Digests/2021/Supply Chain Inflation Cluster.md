# Supply Chain Inflation Cluster

<div class="keyword-row">
  <span class="inline-keyword">supply</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">inflation</span>

  <span class="inline-keyword">prices</span>

</div>

This cluster connects port congestion, factory slowdowns, and shipping delays to inflation pressure. The common thread is bottlenecks in physical flow, not just demand.

## signals
- Shipping delays translated into higher consumer prices.
- Logistics became a primary inflation channel.
- Production throttles amplified scarcity.
- Bottlenecks persisted longer than expected.
- Inventory strategy shifted toward resilience.

## my take
Inflation in 2021 wasn’t only monetary; it was logistical. That reality changes how we interpret price spikes.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Bottleneck:</strong> Physical flow sets price floors.</li>
  <li><strong>Lag:</strong> Delays accumulate into inflation.</li>
  <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Firms start paying for slack.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Logistics is macro data now.</li>
  <li><strong>Shift:</strong> Supply chain risk moved into pricing models.</li>
</ul>
