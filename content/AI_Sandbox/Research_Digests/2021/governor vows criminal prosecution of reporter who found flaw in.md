# governor vows criminal prosecution of reporter who found flaw in state website

*see also:* [[Open Source Supply Chain]] · [[Governance Drift]]

Governor vows criminal prosecution of reporter who found flaw in state website surfaced as a high-signal public thread and points to a broader shift in how builders respond to the current cycle ([source](https://missouriindependent.com/2021/10/14/missouri-governor-vows-criminal-prosecution-of-reporter-who-found-flaw-in-state-website/)). I see it as a hinge between immediate outcomes and longer-term incentives. The headline is not just the event but the behavior it reveals.

## context + claim
The piece aggregates evidence around governor vows criminal prosecution of reporter who found flaw in state website, giving a snapshot of how the trend is moving. My claim: the data shows a structural shift that operators should treat as baseline, not a temporary spike.

## signal vs noise
- Signal: directional change that persists across multiple metrics.
- Signal: alignment between reported data and operator anecdotes.
- Noise: one-off outliers that look dramatic but do not change the baseline.

## risk surface
- Over-rotation on the headline could mask second-order costs.
- Early adopters take execution risk while incumbents take narrative risk.
- If incentives misalign, the outcome becomes a short-lived spike instead of a durable shift.

## my take
I treat this as a directional signal, not a definitive answer. The right response is to adjust posture while keeping the option to reverse if the signal fades.
