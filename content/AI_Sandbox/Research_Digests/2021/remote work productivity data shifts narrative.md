# remote work productivity data shifts narrative

Data from numerous surveys in late 2021 shows hybrid workers reporting higher productivity than full-office, reinforcing [[remote work normalizes across platforms]].

## signal braid
- Hybrid is now the new baseline, echoing supply chain flexibility from [[slack is a luxury in supply chains]].
- Productivity worries led to more structured scenario planning like [[climate anxiety pushes infra teams into scenario planning]].

## my take
Hybrid signals are sticky; I now embed them into hiring and workspace planning.

## ending questions
How much hybrid can a company sustain before culture slips?
