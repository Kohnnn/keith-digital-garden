# fao food price index cools from march spike

The UN FAO Food Price Index dropped to 135.7 points in November 2022, down from March’s record 159.7 but still 0.3% higher year on year ([FAO](https://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en/)).

## metric snapshot
- Vegetable oil index down 27% from peak after Indonesia eased export controls.
- Cereal prices still 6% above 2021 due to war-related disruptions (linked to [[ukraine grain corridor restarts black sea exports]]).
- Sugar and dairy fell modestly as supply improved.

## signal braid
- The grain corridor kept wheat inflation in check, showing geopolitics still sets the tone.
- Energy cost relief (diesel, gas) slowly filtered into fertilizer markets, connecting to [[diesel inventories slip to crisis lows in us]].
- Central banks now get breathing room, supporting the Fed’s “pause-and-watch” stance noted elsewhere.

## my take
Food prices cooled but remain fragile. Any new shock—weather, war—pushes the index back up, so hedging remains essential.

## ending questions
What structural investments would keep the FAO index from spiking the next time geopolitics flares?
