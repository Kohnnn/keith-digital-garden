When southwest airlines  a case study in brittleness hit, the obvious story was the headline. The less obvious story is the boundary it moves. I’m using the source as a reference point, not a full explanation ([source](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2022/12/28/southwest-airlines-a-case-study-in-brittleness/)).

## scene
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[Model Behavior]] and [[Compute Bottlenecks]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## clues
- The operational details around southwest airlines  a case study in brittleness matter more than the announcement cadence.
- The dependency chain around southwest airlines  a case study in brittleness is where risk accumulates, not at the surface.
- The first order win is clarity; the second order cost is optionality.

## signal vs noise
- Noise: demos and commentary overstate production readiness.
- Signal: procurement and compliance are quietly shaping the outcome.
- Noise: early excitement won’t survive the next budget cycle.
- Signal: the rollout path is designed for institutional buyers.

## time horizon
Short term, this looks like a capability win. Mid term, it becomes a budgeting and compliance question. Long term, the dominant path is whichever reduces coordination cost.

## my take
I’m leaning toward treating this as structural. Build for the default that’s forming, but keep an exit path.
