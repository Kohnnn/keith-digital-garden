# tiktok in russia and ukraine

*see also:* [[LLMs]] · [[Model Behavior]]

The report felt like a case study in how platforms can reshape reality across borders. My read is that feed variance is now a geopolitical variable.

## scene cut
An investigation showed TikTok feeds differed radically between Russia and Ukraine, altering what each audience could see ([source](https://www.nrk.no/osloogviken/xl/tiktok-doesn_t-show-the-war-in-ukraine-to-russian-users-1.15921522)). The platform became an information border.

## signal braid
- Feed governance creates parallel realities.
- Platform rules can act like censorship.
- War narratives are now platform-shaped.
- The dynamic echoes [[Russia Invades Ukraine]].

## contrast seam
default read: content moderation / counter read: information border control.

## my take
I think platform policy is now a soft power tool. When feeds diverge, so does public memory.

## ending questions
How should platforms disclose country-level feed changes?
