# ai funding shifts toward safety and services

PitchBook reported that the first three quarters of 2023 saw a 22% drop in pure-play large model rounds, while safety, fine-tuning, and services companies captured 45% of AI deal volume ([PitchBook AI Report](https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/ai-investment-2023)). Investors now favor lower-hype, higher-impact applications.

## evidence stack
- Safety tooling rounds grew +38% YoY.
- Commercial AI services (document automation, vertical copilots) dominated Series A valuations.
- Hardware funding for accelerators cooled as chip shortages eased.
- Regulatory signals (see [[eu ai act finalizes compliance timeline]]) drive investor interest in audit and governance platforms.

## linkage anchor
This digest connects funding shifts to policy and risk narratives already documented in the vault, especially the AI Act and GPT-4 governance debates.

## my take
Investors now price in staying-power; hype projects without clear ROI struggle to raise.

## ending questions
Will venture capital continue to prize safety and services if economic growth slows?
