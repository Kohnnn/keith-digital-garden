# ai workloads raise energy demand data

Uptime Institute’s Q3 survey shows AI training clusters now account for a 12% year-over-year increase in data center energy demand, with 45% of surveyed operators planning dedicated hydrogen or grid reserves ([Uptime Institute](https://uptimeinstitute.com/research/2023-energy-survey)).

## metric snapshot
- 12% YoY jump in data center demand linked to AI training.
- 45% preparing dedicated reserves or hydrogen boosters.
- 31% anticipating demand ceilings before 2025.

## signal braid
- The increase is the same pressure underlying [[global renewables additions keep pace despite geopolitics]]; energy must grow with AI.
- It accentuates the transparency push in [[eu climate rules demand data center transparency]].

## my take
AI’s appetite is real energy demand. I now ask vendors for the specific watts per inference before selecting a provider.

## ending questions
When will dedicated AI energy budgets include carbon accounting like factories do?
