# chainalysis 2023 crypto crime report

*see also:* [[LLMs]] · [[Model Behavior]]

Chainalysis’ 2023 Crypto Crime Report estimated illicit addresses received $20.1B in 2022, down from 2021, but DeFi hacks doubled and North Korea-linked actors grabbed the largest share ([Chainalysis](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/crypto-crime-report-2023/)).

## evidence stack
- Total illicit volume down due to fewer centralized exchange rug pulls.
- DeFi protocols accounted for 69% of hacked funds.
- North Korean actors stole $1.7B, often laundering through mixers resembling Tornado Cash.
- Ransomware payments ticked up despite improved reporting.

## signal braid
- The data proves regulators will keep pushing compliance memos like [[sec ramps crypto oversight with new policy memo]].
- Mixers under sanction (see [[tornado cash sanctions redraw crypto privacy lines]]) remain prime laundering tools.
- Institutional investors now factor DeFi hack risk into treasury policies.

## my take
Crypto crime is consolidating: less petty fraud, more high-skill DeFi hits. Governance and audits matter more than ever.

## ending questions
Will DeFi builders fund third-party security by default now that the data shows they are the primary targets?
