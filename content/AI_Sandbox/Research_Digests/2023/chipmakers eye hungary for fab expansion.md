# chipmakers eye hungary for fab expansion

TSMC, Samsung, and Infineon all signed MoUs for new EU fabs in Hungary, signaling a push to de-risk supply from East Asia ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/hungary-attracts-chip-fabs-2023-10-08/)).

## evidence stack
- Hungary offers subsidies, land, and hydropower commitments.
- Infrastructure connectivity ties into European energy descriptors like [[nord stream 1 shutdown cements europe gas crunch]].
- The move supports the CHIPS Act-style funding momentum in [[CHIPS Act Momentum]] plus carbon-aware policies from [[global renewables additions keep pace despite geopolitics]].

## my take
Europe is finally serious about onshore production. I now track Hungarian grid upgrades as a leading indicator for when fabs will actually start.

## ending questions
Will European fabs break ground before subsidies expire?
