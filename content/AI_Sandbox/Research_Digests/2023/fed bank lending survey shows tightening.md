# fed bank lending survey shows tightening

The Federal Reserve's July 2023 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey found widespread tightening of standards in commercial and industrial loans, a rare consensus view since 2020 ([Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/data/sloos/sloos-202307.htm)). The data hints at serious credit stress across regions.

## metric snapshot
- 40% of banks tightened C&I lending standards (vs 7% easing last quarter).
- Small business lending saw a 25% net tightening signal.
- Demand for mortgages and commercial RE still soft.
- Loan spreads widened by approximately 30 bps.

## signal braid
- This tightening matches the liquidity script we observed after [[svb collapse rewrites depositor trust]].
- Risk premiums are creeping up, which feeds back into capital markets and the general-note narrative.
- The data aligns with tighter deposit behavior seen in [[three arrows liquidation exposes leverage maze]].

## linkage anchor
This research ties to the bank failure narrative and also explains why inflation discussions like [[inflation hits 9.1 percent]] still need credit context.

## my take
The Fed is done with easy money; this survey is a preview of rate decisions before CPI can catch up.

## ending questions
If credit tightens further, which industry will show the earliest distress signals next?
