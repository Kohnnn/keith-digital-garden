# global airfreight index rebounds amid e commerce

*see also:* [[LLMs]] · [[Model Behavior]]

The TAC Index climbed 12% in September as ecommerce retailers pulled forward inventory ahead of holiday season, reversing earlier softness ([TAC Index](https://www.tac-index.com/)). Air freight is now a leading indicator for whether physical demand is recovering.

## metric snapshot
- TAC Asia–Europe average rate: +12% YoY.
- Load factors jumped to 81%, the highest since 2022.
- Premium for express lanes widened to $4.20/kg.
- Transit times shortened by 1.2 days as carriers added charters.

## signal braid
- The rebound mirrors the logistic flip we saw in [[container rates collapse as demand evaporates]] when demand returns quickly.
- Airfreight's volatility shows why rail strike risk in [[us rail strike averted by tentative labor deal]] still matters.
- Higher rates feed into both inflation (see [[inflation hits 9.1 percent]]) and chip inventory decisions.

## linkage anchor
Airfreight data acts as a short-term demand gauge and connects to the macro picture captured by [[fed bank lending survey shows tightening]].

## my take
When airfreight tightens, I assume inventories refilling—it's the canary for retail and manufacturing demand.

## ending questions
If air freight stays tight, will manufacturers keep building inventories or let backlogs linger?
