# global renewables additions keep pace despite geopolitics

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

IEA data shows 220 GW of solar and wind were added worldwide through September 2023, roughly matching last year despite supply-chain challenges from sanctions on Russia and China ([IEA Renewables](https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2023)). The resilience feeds energy security narratives.

## metric snapshot
- Solar additions: 145 GW YTD.
- Wind additions: 75 GW YTD.
- Grid storage capacity up 64% YoY.
- Investment in renewables now 20% of total energy capex.

## signal braid
- These additions support the policy logic in [[g7 price cap gambit targets russian revenue]] by lowering dependency on Russian oil.
- The storage surge helps explain why diesel volatility in [[diesel inventories slip to crisis lows in us]] is less dramatic than feared.

## linkage anchor
This digest anchors the energy narrative and ties into multiple strategic pieces like the G7 price cap and diesel note.

## my take
Geopolitics is still tightening access to fossil fuels, so the renewable capacity is the only reliable balancing instrument.

## ending questions
Can renewables keep pace if new sanctions disrupt rare earth supply chains?
