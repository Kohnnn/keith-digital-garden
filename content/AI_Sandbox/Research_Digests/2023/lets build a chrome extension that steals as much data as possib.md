Let's build a Chrome extension that steals as much data as possible lands as a clean signal for the current cycle ([source](https://mattfrisbie.substack.com/p/spy-chrome-extension)). The point is not the news itself but the behavioral drift it exposes. I care about what becomes default after the dust settles.

## context + claim
let's build a chrome extension that steals as much data as possible shifts the center of gravity toward a new default. My claim is simple: this is a habit-forming change, not a one-off event. If teams internalize the behavior, the market follows.

## signal vs noise
- Signal: behavior that persists without marketing support.
- Signal: policy or tooling that narrows future choices.
- Noise: impressive demos without a maintenance story.

## risk surface
- The promise outruns operational reality.
- Costs shift from build to maintenance without warning.
- The narrative locks in before the evidence matures.

## my take
I am leaning cautious: treat the change as real, but do not calcify it until the operational story holds.

## ending questions
What would make this feel durable instead of episodic?
