Most data work seems fundamentally worthless reads like a small event and a big signal at the same time ([source](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/most-data-work-seems-fundamentally-worthless/)). The point is not the headline, it is the behavioral drift it reveals. I care about what becomes default after the dust settles.

## context + claim
most data work seems fundamentally worthless shifts the center of gravity toward a new default. My claim: this is a habit-forming change, not a one-off event. If teams internalize the behavior, the market follows.

## signal vs noise
- Signal: behavior that persists without marketing support.
- Signal: policy or tooling that narrows future choices.
- Noise: impressive demos without a maintenance story.

## risk surface
- The promise outruns operational reality.
- Costs shift from build to maintenance without warning.
- The narrative locks in before the evidence matures.

## my take
I am leaning cautious: treat the change as real, but do not calcify it until the operational story holds.
