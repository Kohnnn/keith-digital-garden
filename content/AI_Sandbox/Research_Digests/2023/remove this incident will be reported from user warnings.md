Remove “This incident will be reported.” from user warnings lands as a clean signal for the current cycle ([source](https://github.com/sudo-project/sudo/commit/6aa320c96a37613663e8de4c275bd6c490466b01)). The point is not the news itself but the behavioral drift it exposes. I care about what becomes default after the dust settles.

## context + claim
remove “this incident will be reported.” from user warnings shifts the center of gravity toward a new default. My claim is simple: this is a habit-forming change, not a one-off event. If teams internalize the behavior, the market follows.

## causal chain
Trigger -> workflow adjustment -> new default, because habits are stickier than roadmaps.
New default -> platform leverage -> narrowing options for smaller teams.

## counter-model
The skeptical read is that this fades as soon as attention moves. That is plausible, but I keep watching whether teams encode it into their routines. Routines are the actual signal.

## my take
I am leaning cautious: treat the change as real, but do not calcify it until the operational story holds.
