# renewable battery costs fall sharply

BloombergNEF reports a YoY 8% decline in average lithium-ion battery pack costs, easing one of the last barriers for variable renewables to pair with storage ([BNEF](https://about.bnef.com/blog/lithium-ion-battery-pack-prices-fall/)).

## metric snapshot
- Average cost now $130/kWh, down from $141/kWh last year.
- Residential storage deployments up 16% as incentives align.
- Pairing with solar/wind is now economically viable in 23 U.S. states.

## signal braid
- Lower costs support the renewable additions noted in [[global renewables additions keep pace despite geopolitics]].
- The data also gives energy-hungry AI clusters an efficiency path, aligning with [[ai workloads raise energy demand data]].

## my take
Storage economics are the last mile. Every 10% drop in battery costs buys room for more AI compute without burning fossil fuel.

## ending questions
How many more percent-point drops before battery storage becomes standard in hyperscale racks?
