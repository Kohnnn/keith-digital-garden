# stack overflow developer survey tracks ai adoption

*see also:* [[LLMs]] · [[Model Behavior]]

Stack Overflow’s survey found 70% of professional respondents are using or planning to use AI assistants, with GitHub Copilot leading mindshare ([Stack Overflow](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/)).

## metric snapshot
- 77% of professional developers view AI positively.
- 33% worry about security/copyright; 28% fear skills erosion.
- AI features ranked as the top requested improvement in IDEs.

## signal braid
- Adoption rates justify corporate rollouts like [[github copilot for business launches]].
- Enthusiasm plus anxiety mirrors the knowledge ownership debates in [[ai copilots loosen ownership of knowledge]].
- Teams now see AI literacy as table stakes, influencing hiring and L&D budgets.

## my take
Developers are pragmatists. They’ll embrace AI if it accelerates work, but they expect enterprises to manage risk. Surveys like this push execs to invest in policy and training simultaneously.

## ending questions
What governance frameworks keep AI assistants from accidentally leaking code while still boosting productivity?
