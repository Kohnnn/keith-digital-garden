# startup layoffs track from spreadsheet middle

Crunchbase recorded roughly 432 startup layoffs across AI, FinTech, and crypto in 2023, with AI accounting for 28% of the total despite being the hottest sector ([Crunchbase](https://news.crunchbase.com/ai-startup-layoffs-2023/)).

## metric snapshot
- 432 layoffs total; 121 from AI-focused firms.
- Average size of layoffs: 42 employees.
- Majority cite capital runway concerns rather than product failure.

## signal braid
- The metrics confirm the risk atmosphere described in [[ai risk stories drive market narratives]] and extend the credit squeeze seen in [[fed bank lending survey shows tightening]].
- Layoffs push talent into service roles or open-source efforts akin to [[open source maintainers need crisis budgets]].

## my take
Talent cycles react faster than valuations. I now see layoffs as leading indicators for product pivots rather than kill switches.

## ending questions
Which layoffs signal real repositioning versus temporary runway preservation?
