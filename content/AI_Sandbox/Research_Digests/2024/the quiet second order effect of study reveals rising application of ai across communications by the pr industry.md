The headline makes it feel settled. It isn’t. study reveals rising application of ai across communications by the pr industry is moving the line on what people accept as normal, and that is the part I care about ([source](https://today.usc.edu/study-reveals-rising-application-of-ai-across-communications-by-the-public-relations-industry/)).

## why this matters
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[Model Behavior]] and [[Compute Bottlenecks]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## field notes
- The dependency chain around study reveals rising application of ai across communications by the pr industry is where risk accumulates, not at the surface.
- What looks like a surface change is actually a control move.

## what to watch
- Noise: demos and commentary overstate production readiness.
- Signal: incentives now favor stability over novelty.
- Signal: procurement and compliance are quietly shaping the outcome.
- Noise: early excitement won’t survive the next budget cycle.

## risk surface

- study reveals rising application of ai across communications by the pr industry amplifies model brittleness faster than the value it returns.
- The smallest edge case in study reveals rising application of ai across communications by the pr industry becomes the largest reputational risk.

## my take
I’m leaning toward treating this as structural. Build for the default that’s forming, but keep an exit path.
