# alphafold 2 breaks protein folding logjam

DeepMind published AlphaFold 2 results that matched experimental protein folding accuracy, turning a 50-year biology problem into an AI benchmark ([DeepMind AlphaFold](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology)). The breakthrough proves neural nets can capture complex physics.

## scene cut
AlphaFold 2 uses Evoformer architecture and attention to consider residue pairs and spatial relationships, not just sequences.

## signal braid
- The system dethroned CASP competitions, showing AI can match labs.
- Pharmaceutical firms now treat AI tools as R&D accelerators similar to how AI already shakes biotech in [[copilot and the autocomplete layer]].
- Protein predictions can feed into vaccine design, aligning with the same health urgency fueling [[ppe supply chain scramble]].

## risk surface
- Published predictions may still need lab validation.
- Firms with the wet-lab capacity will have a big advantage, creating new inequality.
- Data biases in structural databases might mislead some predictions.

## my take
AlphaFold 2 is the first AI system that truly feels like science rather than a product; it predicts shapes faster than any lab could measure.

## ending questions
How much faster can drug discovery go when every candidate has a predicted 3D structure?
