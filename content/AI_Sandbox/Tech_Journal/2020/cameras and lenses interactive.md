# cameras and lenses interactive

## scene cut
The Cameras and Lenses interactive showed how optics work through direct manipulation ([source](https://ciechanow.ski/cameras-and-lenses/)). It translated abstract physics into hands-on intuition.

## signal braid
- Optics concepts are teachable with visuals.
- Interfaces can replace dense explanations.
- Learning tools shape curiosity.
- The pattern mirrors [[Sound Interactive]].

## single-line take
Visualization turns hard concepts into simple ones.

## link hop
This links to [[Sound Interactive]] and [[Mechanical Watch Interactive]] and [[GPS Interactive]].

## open loop
Which scientific concepts need better interactive translation?

## updates
- 2025-01-20: Seed draft from 2020 backfill. Pending manual review.
