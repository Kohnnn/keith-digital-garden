# deno 1.0

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

## scene cut
Deno 1.0 shipped as a secure-by-default JavaScript runtime with built-in tooling ([source](https://deno.land/v1)). The release reopened the conversation about runtime defaults and developer ergonomics.

## signal braid
- Secure defaults are now a selling point.
- Built-in tooling reduces dependency sprawl.
- Runtime choices are ecosystem bets.
- The posture aligns with [[Whisper Open Source Speech Recognition]].

## single-line take
Runtime defaults are product strategy, not just engineering taste.

## link hop

## open loop
Which runtime defaults should be non-negotiable now?
