# gears interactive

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

## scene cut
The Gears interactive broke down mechanical motion into clear visual sequences ([source](https://ciechanow.ski/gears/)). It showed how interfaces can teach physics faster than text.

## signal braid
- Interactive explanations compress complexity.
- Visual pacing can teach mechanical intuition.
- Long-form web still matters for learning.
- The craft echoes [[Mechanical Watch Interactive]].

## single-line take
Great teaching often looks like interface design.

## link hop
This connects to [[Mechanical Watch Interactive]] and [[Sound Interactive]] and [[GPS Interactive]].

## open loop
Which other mechanical systems deserve this treatment?
