# github codespaces

## scene cut
GitHub announced Codespaces, positioning dev environments as an on-demand cloud service ([source](https://github.com/features/codespaces)). It made environment setup a platform feature instead of a local chore.

## signal braid
- Development workflow shifts toward cloud defaults.
- Environment standardization reduces onboarding friction.
- Tooling vendors capture more of the stack.
- The workflow ambition aligns with [[Building a VM Inside ChatGPT]].

## single-line take
When the environment is hosted, workflow becomes a platform moat.

## link hop
This links to [[Building a VM Inside ChatGPT]] and [[SD My Script Directory]] and [[github free for teams]].

## open loop
Which parts of dev setup still need local control?

## updates
- 2025-03-06: Seed draft from 2020 backfill. Pending manual review.
