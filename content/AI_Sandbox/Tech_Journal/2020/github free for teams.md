# github free for teams

*see also:* [[Open Source Supply Chain]] · [[Governance Drift]]

## scene cut
GitHub made team features free, lowering barriers to collaboration for small groups ([source](https://github.blog/2020-04-14-github-is-now-free-for-teams/)). The move reframed collaboration as a default rather than a premium.

## signal braid
- Pricing shifts can reshape developer workflows.
- Access changes influence adoption velocity.
- Collaboration tooling is now table stakes.
- The trust angle overlaps with [[We Lost 54k GitHub Stars]].

## single-line take
Access decisions are ecosystem design decisions.

## link hop
This links to [[We Lost 54k GitHub Stars]] and [[SD My Script Directory]] and [[Platform Accountability Cluster]].

## open loop
Which collaboration features should be considered public infrastructure?
