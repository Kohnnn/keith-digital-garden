# ios14 clipboard snooping

## scene cut
iOS14 exposed that TikTok and other apps were reading clipboard data, a behavior revealed through system notifications ([source](https://twitter.com/jeremyburge/status/1275896482433040386)). The moment turned a hidden behavior into a public privacy signal.

## signal braid
- OS transparency changes user trust quickly.
- App behavior visibility drives policy pressure.
- Privacy controls are now a product differentiator.
- The visibility theme matches [[Surveillance Normalized]].

## single-line take
Transparency features can be more powerful than enforcement.

## link hop
This connects to [[Surveillance Normalized]] and [[NSO and the Entity List]] and [[Trust in Platforms]].

## open loop
Which privacy behaviors remain invisible to users?
