# magento becomes critical patch train

*see also:* [[LLMs]] · [[Model Behavior]]

Lagging patches in Magento stores made headlines, resembling the supply chain panic in [[supply chain issues killing synth companies]] where a single missing dependency caused widespread delays.

## signal braid
- Shows how ecommerce infrastructure ties into data trust issues similar to [[zoom security meltdown exposes cryptography gaps]].
- Reinforces that open-source platforms require dedicated effort, as in [[open source maintainers need crisis budgets]].

## my take
I now treat open-source commerce stacks like critical infrastructure; patch cadence must be weekly.

## ending questions
Who owns patch enforcement when open-source teams disappear?
