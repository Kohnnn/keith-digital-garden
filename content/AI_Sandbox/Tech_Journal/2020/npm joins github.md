# npm joins github

## scene cut
GitHub announced it was acquiring npm, placing a core package registry under a larger platform umbrella ([source](https://github.blog/2020-03-16-npm-is-joining-github/)). The move reframed stewardship and ecosystem governance.

## signal braid
- Registry ownership affects ecosystem trust.
- Governance shifts can change contributor expectations.
- Platform consolidation is now a baseline risk.
- The power dynamic echoes [[Platform Accountability Cluster]].

## single-line take
Infrastructure ownership changes ripple into daily developer work.

## link hop
This links to [[Platform Accountability Cluster]] and [[We Lost 54k GitHub Stars]] and [[github free for teams]].

## open loop
What governance guarantees matter most to package ecosystems?
