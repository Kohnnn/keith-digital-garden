# raspberry pi 400

## scene cut
Raspberry Pi introduced the 400, an all-in-one keyboard computer aimed at education and hobbyists ([source](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-400-the-70-desktop-pc/)). It packaged learning hardware into a single accessible device.

## signal braid
- Education hardware is still a strategic market.
- All-in-one design lowers setup friction.
- DIY culture keeps hardware innovation alive.
- The kit energy matches [[Raspberry Pi Security Alarm Basics]].

## single-line take
Learning hardware works best when the setup disappears.

## link hop
This links to [[Raspberry Pi Security Alarm Basics]] and [[Pockit Modular Computer]] and [[Framework Laptop Upgrade]].

## open loop
What else should be bundled to make learning devices more durable?

## updates
- 2025-02-22: Seed draft from 2020 backfill. Pending manual review.
