## scene cut
Epic's first look at Unreal Engine 5 showcased real-time rendering advances and new tooling for creators ([source](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/a-first-look-at-unreal-engine-5)). The demo moved graphics expectations forward.

## signal braid
- Real-time quality is closing the offline gap.

- Engine demos are marketing and roadmap signals.
- The creative tooling conversation aligns with [[Adobe to Acquire Figma]].
