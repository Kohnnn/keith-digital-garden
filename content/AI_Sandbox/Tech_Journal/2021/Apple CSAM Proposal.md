Apple’s child safety proposal lit up a core tension: user privacy versus platform responsibility. The proposal aimed to detect illegal content, but the mechanism felt like a new line being crossed. The reaction was not just technical; it was about precedent.

I read it as a boundary test. Once a platform scans for one category of content, the question becomes what else can be scanned and under what pressure. <span class="inline-claim">A narrow exception can widen into a new default</span>.

The other signal is trust. Platforms build trust by saying “we can’t see your data,” and lose trust when that promise feels conditional. The policy question is not just whether the goal is right, but whether the mechanism shifts the relationship.

## signals
- Safety goals can trigger privacy backlash when mechanisms change.
- Precedent matters more than intent.
- Platform trust is fragile under policy pressure.
- Technical safeguards do not erase governance concerns.
- Public trust is shaped by perceived boundaries.

## my take
This was a reminder that privacy is a product feature and a social contract. If the contract changes, the product changes. The lesson is not “never act,” but “measure the trust cost.”

I keep this linked to [[Haugen and the Internal Files]] because both are about platform responsibility and the limits of trust.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Boundary:</strong> Exceptions become future pathways.</li>
  <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Promises shape platform legitimacy.</li>
  <li><strong>Pressure:</strong> Policy asks rarely stop at one use case.</li>
  <li><strong>Design:</strong> Mechanisms matter as much as intent.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> The relationship with users is the real asset.</li>
</ul>
