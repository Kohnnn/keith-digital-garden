# CHIPS Act Momentum

The CHIPS Act gained momentum as policymakers treated semiconductors as strategic infrastructure. The core logic was resilience: onshoring capacity and reducing dependence. It was a supply chain policy wrapped in national security framing.

I read it as a subsidy signal. Once governments move, capital follows. <span class="inline-claim">Industrial policy becomes capital policy</span>.

The risk is long timelines. Fabs take years, and policy cycles are shorter. The gap between policy intent and capacity reality is the real tension.

## signals
- Semiconductors moved into the security policy tier.
- Subsidies became a lever for supply resilience.
- Timelines are multi‑year, not multi‑quarter.
- Policy decisions shape global capacity allocation.
- Capital moves faster than physical buildout.

## my take
This was a strategic shift. The open question is whether the policy pace can match the capacity pace.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Chips are now a security priority.</li>
  <li><strong>Capital:</strong> Subsidies shape where factories go.</li>
  <li><strong>Lag:</strong> Buildout takes longer than headlines.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Policy cycles can outrun engineering cycles.</li>
  <li><strong>Supply:</strong> Resilience is the new metric.</li>
</ul>
