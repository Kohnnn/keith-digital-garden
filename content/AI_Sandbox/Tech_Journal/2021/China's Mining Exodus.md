China’s mining crackdown was a rare moment where policy produced an immediate, measurable system effect. Hashrate dropped fast, miners unplugged, and equipment moved across borders. This was not a slow regulatory drift. It was a hard stop, and the network had to absorb it.

I read the event as a reminder that infrastructure follows policy more than ideology. People talked about decentralization as a principle, but the real test was geographic concentration. When one region turns off the power, decentralization becomes a logistical challenge. The network survived, but it was a stress test of how quickly it can re-route physical infrastructure.

The other signal is energy exposure. Mining is not just computation; it is a power arbitrage. When a policy change cuts off cheap power, the economics flip. <span class="inline-claim">Energy policy is a protocol parameter</span> in practice, even if it lives outside the code.

## signals
- Hashrate shocks are now policy-driven, not only market-driven.
- Mining follows energy economics more than ideology.
- Geographic concentration is still a systemic risk.
- Migration costs introduce friction and temporary insecurity.
- Regulatory actions can reshape network topology overnight.

## my take
This was a decentralization audit. The network held, but the cost was visible: slower blocks, lower security, and a short-term confidence hit. The long-term effect was healthier distribution, but only after real friction. It showed that decentralization is not a status; it is a process that depends on logistics and power markets.

The move also shifted the narrative around sovereignty. If miners are forced to migrate, they begin to think about jurisdiction as part of their operational stack. That means mining is no longer a neutral industry; it becomes a regulated infrastructure business. That change will echo in future policy debates.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Policy:</strong> Regulation can move hardware faster than markets can.</li>
  <li><strong>Energy:</strong> Cheap power is the real substrate.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Geographic concentration is a silent vulnerability.</li>
  <li><strong>Logistics:</strong> Migration costs are real, not theoretical.</li>
  <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Survival is not the same as stability.</li>
</ul>

I keep this tied to [[EIP-1559 and the Fee Burn]] because both are moments where protocol economics met external pressure. One is code, the other is policy, but they shape incentives the same way. I also link it near [[Bitcoin as a State Experiment]] because both show how governance and adoption collide.
