# Crypto Tax Reporting Push

The reporting provisions in the U.S. infrastructure bill turned crypto policy into a practical tooling problem. The language was broad, and the industry reaction was immediate. This was not a theoretical debate; it was a question of who could realistically comply.

I read it as a compliance design test. If policy requires data that platforms do not have, it forces them to either rebuild their architecture or exit. That is not neutral. It shapes which models survive. <span class="inline-claim">Compliance rules can reshape the product surface</span>.

The other signal was narrative backlash. The policy was sold as tax enforcement, but the fear was that it would push innovation offshore. That tension is now a recurring pattern: policymakers want visibility, builders want flexibility, and the public wants both.

## signals
- Broad reporting requirements can unintentionally capture non-custodial actors.
- Compliance costs act as a competitive filter.
- Policy details matter more than headlines for ecosystem design.
- Regulation debates now move at the speed of developer ecosystems.
- Tax enforcement and surveillance concerns are now linked.

## my take
This episode made it clear that crypto regulation is an infrastructure issue. If a policy requires data, then data collection becomes part of the product. That is a governance choice. The best outcomes come when policy understands how systems actually work.

I keep this linked to [[China's Mining Exodus]] because both show how policy reshapes the technical landscape. One is a crackdown, the other is a compliance shift, but both move the map.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Definitions decide who is regulated.</li>
  <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Compliance favors large, centralized players.</li>
  <li><strong>Data:</strong> Reporting requirements change product design.</li>
  <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Policy now has to keep up with code.</li>
  <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Surveillance fears drive resistance.</li>
</ul>
