# intel foundry pivot

Intel’s foundry pivot was a competitive reset. By opening fabs to external customers, the company aimed to challenge dominant foundries and reposition itself in the global supply chain. It was both a business strategy and a policy alignment.

I read it as a capacity play. When supply is constrained, every new foundry plan becomes a strategic lever. <span class="inline-claim">Foundry capacity is now geopolitical leverage</span>.

The risk is execution and timing. Building fabs is slow, and competition is already deep.

## signals
- Foundry strategy reshapes competitive dynamics.
- Capacity expansion is now tied to national policy.
- Capital intensity raises execution pressure.
- Supply chain resilience is the new narrative.
- Competition moves from design to manufacturing.

## my take
This pivot is a long-term bet. The payoff depends on delivery and sustained demand.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Supply is the new competitive edge.</li>
  <li><strong>Time:</strong> Fabs take years to matter.</li>
  <li><strong>Policy:</strong> National strategy now shapes business moves.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Execution is the main bottleneck.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Manufacturing is back at the center.</li>
</ul>
