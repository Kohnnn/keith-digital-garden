The M1 Pro and M1 Max launch felt like a reset on what a laptop is supposed to optimize. The story was not just raw speed, it was speed per watt and time on battery. Apple framed performance as a sustained state instead of a burst. That shifts how you judge the machine: less about peak benchmarks, more about what it can do without throttling or an outlet.

I read it as a silicon strategy moving up the stack. The hardware is not just a container; it is a policy decision about where computation should happen. If the chip is good enough, the laptop becomes the default studio. That matters because it drags workflows back to the local device and away from cloud-only dependency. It also makes the laptop the main interface again, not a thin client.

The other signal is thermal design. For years, laptop performance was bounded by heat. The M1 generation rewrote that constraint by changing the power curve. The fan is no longer a constant tax. <span class="inline-claim">Thermal ceilings are now strategic constraints, not just engineering ones</span>. That means the product story is now silicon + chassis + battery, not just a faster CPU.

## signals
- Sustained performance displaced burst performance as the selling point.
- The battery became part of the performance budget.
- Local compute regained status against cloud workflows.
- Thermal design moved from afterthought to strategy.
- The chip became the product, not just a component.

## my take
I think this was Apple declaring that workflow gravity is back on the device. If a laptop can render, compile, and edit without lag or fan noise, it becomes the default creative station. That pulls power away from cloud vendors, or at least delays the need to rent it. It also changes how developers and creators plan their stacks.

There is a second-order effect. When the performance story is tied to a custom chip, the product roadmap becomes tightly coupled to the silicon roadmap. That can be a moat, but it is also a dependency. The pace of chip iteration becomes the pace of the product line. That is a new kind of lockstep.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Gravity:</strong> Workflows move toward the machine that feels effortless.</li>
  <li><strong>Thermals:</strong> Heat is the real constraint hidden behind speed.</li>
  <li><strong>Stack:</strong> Custom silicon turns hardware into policy.</li>
  <li><strong>Battery:</strong> Hours on battery become a performance metric.</li>
  <li><strong>Moat:</strong> Chip cadence becomes product cadence.</li>
</ul>

I keep this close to [[Chip Shortage and the Hardware Bottleneck]] because supply reality sets the bounds on how far custom silicon can scale. It also pairs with [[Meta and the AR Bet]] because both are about who owns the interface layer. One is a device surface, the other is a platform surface.
