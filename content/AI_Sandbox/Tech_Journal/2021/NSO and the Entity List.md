# NSO and the Entity List

<div class="keyword-row">
  <span class="inline-keyword">blacklist</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">spyware</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">sanctions</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">policy</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">surveillance</span>
</div>

The U.S. move to blacklist NSO Group marked a shift in how spyware is treated. It moved the conversation from private controversy to official policy action. That changes the incentives for both buyers and sellers in the surveillance market.

I read it as a policy escalation. Once spyware vendors become subject to export-style restrictions, the market contracts and the risk rises. <span class="inline-claim">Sanctions turn surveillance into a geopolitical tool</span>.

The other signal is transparency pressure. Blacklisting raises the demand for disclosure around who buys what and why. That will shape future regulation.

## signals
- Spyware vendors are now policy targets.
- Sanctions change the economics of surveillance tools.
- Transparency demands will increase.
- Buyers face higher reputational risk.
- The policy frame is shifting from crime to geopolitics.

## my take
This action showed that surveillance tooling is no longer treated as a niche market. It is now part of foreign policy. That means the next wave of policy will target not just vendors, but the supply chain that supports them.

I keep this linked to [[Pegasus and the Zero-Click Reality]] because both show how surveillance is moving into official policy lines.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Policy:</strong> Blacklists reshape markets fast.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Buyers inherit new reputational costs.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Surveillance is now strategic, not just technical.</li>
  <li><strong>Supply:</strong> Tooling chains will face scrutiny.</li>
  <li><strong>Pressure:</strong> Transparency becomes a compliance issue.</li>
</ul>
