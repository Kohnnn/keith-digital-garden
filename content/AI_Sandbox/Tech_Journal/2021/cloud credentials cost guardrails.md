# cloud credentials cost guardrails

AWS and Azure introduced credential guardrails to automate key rotation, balancing risk with the spending focus shown in [[Chipmakers Slash Orders with TSMC]].

## signal braid
- Signal: guardrails tie to the zero-trust mania and [[okta breach fallout highlights identity fragility]].
- Signal: tooling integrates with governance dashboards similar to [[remote work normalizes across platforms]].

## risk surface
- Automated rotation costs money; teams resist until a breach occurs.
- Logging increases storage spend.

## my take
Automation is the only path; manual rotation is dead-time in the cloud war.

## ending questions
Which automation still needs human oversight for cloud keys?
