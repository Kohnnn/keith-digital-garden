# meta reality labs builds haptic glove prototype

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

Meta showed off a soft robotic glove with pneumatic actuators and microfluidic sensors that promise realistic haptics inside VR worlds ([Meta](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/meta-haptic-gloves/)).

## scene cut
The glove uses hundreds of air pockets modulated by a custom wristband, creating resistance as virtual objects press against fingers. It’s paired with hand-tracking algorithms to sync visuals and touch.

## signal braid
- Meta wants haptics to be its next moat, complementing the avatar and presence push from [[meta ai craft search answer engine]].
- The glove underscores how XR hardware still needs breakthroughs in materials science, not just GPU muscle.
- Haptics highlight the bandwidth needs captured in [[youtube reduces european streaming quality to ease bandwidth]]; real presence devours data.

## risk surface
- Pneumatic systems require calibration and maintenance, raising cost and fragility.
- Without game/app support, the glove stays in the lab.
- Privacy questions arise when gloves track finger movement as input.

## my take
Haptics could be Meta’s differentiator if they make it affordable, but right now it’s an expensive research demo that needs a killer app.

## ending questions
Can Meta bring this glove to consumers before developers abandon the betaverse dream?
