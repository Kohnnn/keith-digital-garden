# 3D Scan of the Great Pyramid

The interactive 3D scan of the Great Pyramid turned a monument into a navigable model. It made remote exploration feel like a real research interface, not just a tour.

I read it as a data access signal. <span class="inline-claim">Digital models change who can study history</span>.

> High-resolution scans turn heritage into accessible datasets.

> [!question] Reflective question
> How much cultural access should be virtual by default?

## signals
- Visualization tools expand research access.
- Data models become public learning assets.
- Heritage preservation is now a data problem.
- Interactive experiences build new audiences.

## my take
The real shift is accessibility. When high-resolution models are public, research and learning become less gatekept.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Access:</strong> Digital scans expand who can study.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Heritage is now data.</li>
  <li><strong>Value:</strong> Visualization increases public interest.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Context can be lost in raw models.</li>
</ul>
