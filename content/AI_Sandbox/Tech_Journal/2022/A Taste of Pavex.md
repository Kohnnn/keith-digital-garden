# a taste of pavex

## context shard
A preview of the Pavex framework emphasized ergonomics and explicitness in Rust web development ([source](https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/a-taste-of-pavex-rust-web-framework/)). It highlighted design choices that reduce hidden magic.

## signal stack
- Rust web tooling is still evolving quickly.
- Ergonomics are now a competitive factor.
- Explicit design can reduce runtime surprises.
- The tradeoffs echo [[Phoenix 1.7 Is View-less]].

## take line
Framework design is mostly about where you hide complexity.

## link trail
This links to [[Phoenix 1.7 Is View-less]] and [[Write a Wayland Compositor]] and [[I Wrote a SQL Engine in Python]].

## open loop
Which abstractions actually improve safety rather than hide it?
