# Advent of Code on a Playstation

Solving Advent of Code on a Playstation was a playful experiment in constrained programming. It highlighted how creative constraints can make learning more memorable.

I read it as a learning design signal. <span class="inline-claim">Constraints create focus</span>.

> [!note] Core claim
> Constraint-driven builds can deepen learning and creativity.

> [!question] Reflective question
> Which constraints would make your learning sharper instead of harder?

## signals
- Creative constraints can unlock new solutions.
- Playful builds keep skills fresh.
- Learning is faster when the problem is weird.
- Tools are less important than approach.

## my take
This is a reminder that novelty can be a teaching method. When the environment is strange, you learn what you actually understand.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Learning:</strong> Constraints sharpen focus.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Playfulness keeps skills alive.</li>
  <li><strong>Design:</strong> Weird environments reveal assumptions.</li>
  <li><strong>DIY:</strong> Tools matter less than intent.</li>
</ul>
