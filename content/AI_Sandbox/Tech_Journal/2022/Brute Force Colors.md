# brute force colors

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

## context shard
A demo explored the Amiga HAM color mode by brute-forcing palette combinations ([source](https://arnaud-carre.github.io/2022-12-30-amiga-ham/)). It turned constraint into a visual experiment.

## signal stack
- Palette limits can inspire new aesthetics.
- Retro constraints remain a teaching tool.
- Demos are still a valid research format.
- The vibe aligns with [[GameBoy Graphics Part 2 Tile Maps]].

## take line
Constraints are a creative engine when the system is clear.

## link trail
This links to [[GameBoy Graphics Part 2 Tile Maps]] and [[Sound Interactive]] and [[Mechanical Watch Interactive]].

## open loop
What modern graphics systems still hide their constraints from users?
