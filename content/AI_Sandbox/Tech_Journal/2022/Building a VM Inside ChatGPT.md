# Building a VM Inside ChatGPT

<div class="keyword-row">
  <span class="inline-keyword">vm</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">prompt</span>

The experiment of building a virtual machine inside ChatGPT showed how far structure and constraints can push a language model. It framed prompts as a lightweight programming interface.

I read it as a signal about interface design for AI. <span class="inline-note">Constraints are a form of control</span>.

> [!note] Core claim
> Structured prompting can simulate complex systems inside language models.

> [!question] Reflective question
> Where does prompt structure end and programming begin?

## signals
- Prompting can encode real system behavior.
- Constraint design shapes model reliability.
- Users are building tools faster than platforms.
- Interfaces for AI are still unsettled.

## my take
This is a preview of the next tooling layer. The model is the substrate; the interface determines what people can safely build.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Interface:</strong> Prompts are a new programming surface.</li>
  <li><strong>Control:</strong> Constraints are safety and power.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Experiments often become products.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Fragile prompts create fragile tools.</li>
</ul>
