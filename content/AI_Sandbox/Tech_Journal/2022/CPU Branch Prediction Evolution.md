# cpu branch prediction evolution

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

## context shard
A long-form analysis tracked branch prediction techniques across CPU generations ([source](https://danluu.com/branch-prediction/)). It shows how incremental ideas stack into major performance gains.

## signal stack
- Prediction is a compounding performance lever.
- Micro-architecture evolves through small design bets.
- Historical context clarifies modern bottlenecks.
- The hardware arc connects to [[CHIPS Act Momentum]].

## take line
Performance improvements are usually a pile of small wins, not one leap.

## link trail
This links to [[CHIPS Act Momentum]] and [[Nvidia and the Arm Block]] and [[Chipmakers Slash Orders with TSMC]].

## open loop
Which micro-optimizations will define the next decade of CPUs?
