Reports that AMD, Intel, and Nvidia were cutting orders with TSMC signaled a shift in the semiconductor cycle. The message was about inventory adjustment and demand cooling.

I read it as a cycle signal. <span class="inline-claim">Semiconductor demand moves in sharp waves</span>.

## signals
- Inventory corrections move quickly in chips.
- Demand signals propagate through supply chains.
- Capex planning is sensitive to market sentiment.
- Tech cycles remain volatile.

## my take
The headline is about cycle timing. When big buyers pull back, the entire supply chain reprices its expectations.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Cycle:</strong> Chips swing hard between shortage and surplus.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Order cuts are early demand indicators.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Capex can overshoot demand quickly.</li>
  <li><strong>Supply:</strong> Corrections cascade downstream.</li>
</ul>
