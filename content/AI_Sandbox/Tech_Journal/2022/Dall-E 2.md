# Dall-E 2

<div class="keyword-row">
  <span class="inline-keyword">image</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">model</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">prompt</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">creativity</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">risk</span>
</div>

Dall-E 2 moved image generation from novelty to capability. The quality jump made prompts feel like a new creative interface rather than a toy.

I read it as a moment when model quality crossed an adoption threshold. <span class="inline-note">Tooling follows fidelity</span>.

> [!note] Core claim
> Dall-E 2 established prompts as a serious creative input layer.

> [!question] Reflective question
> What parts of visual work become prompts versus craft?

## signals
- Image generation quality jumped dramatically.
- Prompt engineering became a real creative skill.
- Model limits became social and legal questions.
- Creative workflows started to reconfigure.

## my take
The most important shift is not the images, but the interface. Once language becomes the input, the user base expands and the governance questions escalate.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Interface:</strong> Prompts are now a creation layer.</li>
  <li><strong>Scale:</strong> Access drives rapid adoption.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Copyright pressure will follow usage.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Creative AI is now mainstream enough to regulate.</li>
</ul>
