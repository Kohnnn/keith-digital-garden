# draw svg rope using javascript

## context shard
A short tutorial showed how to simulate rope motion using SVG and simple physics ([source](https://muffinman.io/blog/draw-svg-rope-using-javascript/)). It is a reminder that small math demos can teach a lot.

## signal stack
- SVG still works for dynamic visuals.
- Physics demos teach intuition quickly.
- Small projects can be memorable learning anchors.
- The learning cadence matches [[Sound Interactive]].

## take line
A small demo can deliver more intuition than a long explanation.

## link trail
This links to [[Sound Interactive]] and [[Mechanical Watch Interactive]] and [[GameBoy Graphics Part 2 Tile Maps]].

## open loop
What other physics concepts could be taught with a tiny demo?
