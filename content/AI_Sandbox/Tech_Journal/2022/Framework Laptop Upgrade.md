# framework laptop upgrade

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

## context shard
Framework announced an updated laptop with upgradeable components and a stronger repair story ([source](https://community.frame.work/t/introducing-the-new-and-upgraded-framework-laptop/18646)). The release framed modularity as a premium feature, not a compromise.

## signal stack
- Repairability became part of brand identity.
- Supply constraints made longevity more attractive.
- Modular upgrades reduce full-device replacement cycles.
- Demand for smaller devices still shows in [[I Want an iPhone Mini-Sized Android Phone]].

## take line
Repairability is becoming a trust signal, not just a spec.

## link trail
This links to [[I Want an iPhone Mini-Sized Android Phone]] and [[Nvidia and the Arm Block]] and [[CHIPS Act Momentum]].

## open loop
What would make modular upgrades the default expectation for laptops?
