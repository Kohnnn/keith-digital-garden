# GPS Interactive

<div class="keyword-row">

</div>

The GPS interactive broke down timing, relativity, and signal geometry into a coherent mental model. It made a complex system feel almost obvious.

I read it as a map for how to teach infrastructure. <span class="inline-claim">Great education is often great interfaces</span>.

> [!note] Core claim
> GPS is explainable when timing is visualized, not abstracted.

> [!question] Reflective question
> What other invisible systems need this style of explanation?

## signals
- Timing is the hidden engine of navigation.
- Visual models collapse technical complexity.
- The web still supports deep learning experiences.
- Interfaces can teach physics without jargon.

## my take
This is the kind of work that changes how people think about infrastructure. It turns black boxes into understandable systems.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Interface:</strong> Visualization beats abstraction.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Infrastructure literacy can be designed.</li>
  <li><strong>Learning:</strong> Story pacing matters as much as content.</li>
  <li><strong>System:</strong> GPS is a timing network first.</li>
</ul>
