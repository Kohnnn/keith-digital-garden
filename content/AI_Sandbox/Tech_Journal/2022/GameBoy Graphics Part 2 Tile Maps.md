# GameBoy Graphics Part 2 Tile Maps

<div class="keyword-row">

The video breakdown of GameBoy tile maps made constraint-based graphics legible. It showed how old systems still teach important design and rendering lessons.

I read it as a retro learning signal. <span class="inline-note">Constraints make graphics principles visible</span>.

> [!note] Core claim
> Retro systems are still excellent teachers for graphics fundamentals.

> [!question] Reflective question
> What modern systems could benefit from old constraints?

## signals
- Retro constraints are useful for education.
- Tile maps still map to modern UI grids.
- Graphics learning improves with limits.
- Videos make low-level concepts approachable.

## my take
This is a reminder that fundamentals do not expire. Old hardware is still a good teacher when the explanations are clear.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Learning:</strong> Limits expose core mechanics.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Retro tools teach modern skills.</li>
  <li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Tiles are still a useful model.</li>
  <li><strong>Education:</strong> Videos lower barriers to systems knowledge.</li>
</ul>
