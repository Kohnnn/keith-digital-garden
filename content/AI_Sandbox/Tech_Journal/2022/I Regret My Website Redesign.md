# I Regret My Website Redesign

<div class="keyword-row">
  <span class="inline-keyword">redesign</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">usability</span>

</div>

The redesign post is a clean look at how measurable improvements can still miss real user friction. It is a reminder that product wins are not always visible in analytics.

I read it as a feedback loop warning. <span class="inline-claim">Metrics can be precise and still misleading</span>.

> [!note] Core claim
> Redesign success depends on user outcomes, not just numbers.

> [!question] Reflective question
> What signals do we ignore because they are not easy to measure?

## signals
- User trust can drop even when metrics rise.
- Simplification can remove what users value.
- Direct feedback catches blind spots.
- Design is a coordination problem, not just visuals.

## my take
The lesson is to keep some qualitative loops open. If you only listen to dashboards, you will ship the wrong thing faster.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Qualitative signals prevent metric traps.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Redesigns can erase user rituals.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Friction hides inside "good" numbers.</li>
  <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Clarity beats novelty in UX.</li>
</ul>
