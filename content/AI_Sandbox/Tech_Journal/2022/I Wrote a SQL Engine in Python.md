# I Wrote a SQL Engine in Python

Building a SQL engine in Python showed how far careful design can push a high-level language. The project emphasized clarity and learning over raw performance.

I read it as a systems learning signal. <span class="inline-claim">Constraints are a teaching tool</span>.

> [!note] Core claim
> Building systems in Python is viable for learning and clarity.

> [!question] Reflective question
> What is the best way to learn systems thinking without low-level friction?

## signals
- Python remains a viable prototyping language.
- Systems knowledge can be built without C++.
- Clarity beats speed in learning contexts.
- Small projects can teach large architectures.

## my take
The real value is the learning path. It shows that systems thinking can start in a comfortable language and still be rigorous.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Learning:</strong> Constraints make architecture visible.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Python is still a systems teaching tool.</li>
  <li><strong>Design:</strong> Clarity scales understanding.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Performance tradeoffs need to be explicit.</li>
</ul>
