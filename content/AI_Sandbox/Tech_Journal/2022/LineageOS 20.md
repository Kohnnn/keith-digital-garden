# LineageOS 20

<div class="keyword-row">

</div>

LineageOS 20 showed how community maintenance can extend device lifespan and keep old hardware useful. It is a quiet counterweight to planned obsolescence.

I read it as a durability signal. <span class="inline-note">Community maintenance is a form of resilience</span>.

## signals
- Community OS work extends device life.
- Updates are now a user trust factor.
- Privacy features drive alternative OS adoption.
- Repairability and software support converge.

## my take
This is less about niche phones and more about long-term control. When vendors stop supporting devices, community stacks become a form of user sovereignty.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Support cycles can be rewritten.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Community work fills vendor gaps.</li>
  <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Updates are part of product value.</li>
  <li><strong>Control:</strong> Ownership includes software access.</li>
</ul>
