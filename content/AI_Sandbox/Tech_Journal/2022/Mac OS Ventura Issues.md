# mac os ventura issues

## context shard
A roundup documented stability issues after macOS Ventura upgrades, highlighting pain points in early releases ([source](https://morrick.me/archives/9696)). It framed reliability as part of the upgrade decision.

## signal stack
- OS upgrades can carry hidden reliability costs.
- Early adopters absorb the stability risk.
- Reliability shapes long-term trust in ecosystems.
- The pattern echoes [[Windows 11 Launch]].

## take line
Upgrade decisions are trust decisions when reliability is uncertain.

## link trail
This links to [[Windows 11 Launch]] and [[Framework Laptop Upgrade]] and [[State of HTTP in 2022]].

## open loop
How do we set a better default for upgrade timing?
