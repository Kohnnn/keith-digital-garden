Pockit showcased a tiny modular computer built around extendable components. It felt like a reminder that small form factors can still be flexible if the interfaces are clean.

I read it as a hardware craft signal. <span class="inline-note">Modularity scales down when the connectors are right</span>.

## signals
- Modularity remains attractive in constrained hardware.
- DIY ecosystems still drive innovation.
- Small devices can still be repairable.
- Interface design decides extensibility.

## my take
This is a reminder that hardware innovation can be small and still meaningful. It signals that repairability and expansion are still valued.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Design:</strong> Interfaces define modularity.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> DIY builds are still product R and D.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Small scale makes parts fragile.</li>
  <li><strong>Value:</strong> Flexibility builds loyalty.</li>
</ul>
