# RSS Brain

<div class="keyword-row">
  <span class="inline-keyword">rss</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">reader</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">curation</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">focus</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">workflow</span>
</div>

RSS Brain positioned RSS as a way to regain focus and intentional curation. It framed reading as a workflow problem rather than a feed addiction problem.

I read it as a control signal. <span class="inline-note">Curation is a response to attention overload</span>.

<div class="you-might-like">You might like: [[Google Search Is Dying]], [[I Regret My Website Redesign]]</div>

> [!note] Core claim
> RSS tools are resurging as a way to regain control of attention.

> [!question] Reflective question
> What parts of your reading workflow still feel algorithmic?

## signals
- RSS is a counterweight to feeds.
- Curation is valued as a workflow feature.
- Reading tools emphasize focus over volume.
- Personal knowledge tools gain attention.

## my take
The main shift is intention. RSS is not nostalgia; it is a constraint that protects focus and creates better inputs.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Control:</strong> Curation beats algorithm drift.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Reading tools are becoming workflow tools.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Feeds erode attention over time.</li>
  <li><strong>Workflow:</strong> Inputs shape thinking.</li>
</ul>
