# react native is not the future

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

## context shard
The critique argued that React Native is not the long-term path for mobile apps, emphasizing native performance and integration constraints ([source](https://blog.standardnotes.com/40921/no-react-native-is-not-the-future)). It reframed cross-platform tooling as a tradeoff rather than a destiny.

## signal stack
- Cross-platform tools face platform boundary limits.
- Performance ceilings matter for native experiences.
- Tooling decisions encode product constraints.
- The tension parallels [[Tamagui 1.0]].

## take line
Cross-platform stacks are a trade, not a universal solution.

## link trail
This links to [[Tamagui 1.0]] and [[I Regret My Website Redesign]] and [[Framework Laptop Upgrade]].

## open loop
Which product categories still require deep native integration?
