Riffusion showed a lightweight path from diffusion models to music generation. The demo felt less like a research paper and more like a tool that could slip into real workflows.

I read it as a signal that creative AI is moving from image-first to multi-modal. <span class="inline-note">Audio is the next surface area for prompts</span>.

> Generative audio is moving fast enough to be workflow-relevant.

> [!question] Reflective question
> What creative jobs change first when audio becomes prompt-native?

## signals
- Music generation is now demo-ready, not just theoretical.
- Diffusion techniques generalize beyond images.
- Prompting becomes a new composition layer.
- Tooling gets lighter and more accessible.

## my take
The main shift is usability. Once the interface is simple, the adoption curve jumps and the debate moves from novelty to rights and workflows.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Surface:</strong> Audio joins images as a prompt domain.</li>
  <li><strong>Tooling:</strong> The UI matters more than the model spec.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Rights and provenance are still unclear.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Creative AI keeps widening its target.</li>
</ul>
