# sd my script directory

## context shard
SD is a small tool for managing a personal script directory, framing scripts as reusable workflow primitives ([source](https://github.com/ianthehenry/sd)). It treats scripting as infrastructure for daily work.

## signal stack
- Personal scripts become long-term productivity assets.
- Tooling can turn habits into stable interfaces.
- Small tools often carry big leverage.
- The mindset pairs with [[RSS Brain]].

## take line
Workflow clarity often comes from small, durable tools.

## link trail
This links to [[RSS Brain]] and [[Why I'm Still Using Python]] and [[I Wrote a SQL Engine in Python]].

## open loop
Which repeated task should be turned into a single script?
