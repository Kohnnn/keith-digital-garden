# state of http in 2022

## context shard
Cloudflare's report mapped how protocol choices and traffic patterns shape performance at scale ([source](https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-state-of-http-in-2022/)). The web is measured as a system, not a black box.

## signal stack
- Protocol adoption directly impacts user experience.
- Reliability is now a baseline expectation.
- Latency remains a competitive advantage.
- Visibility data complements this in [[Cached Chrome Top Million Websites]].

## take line
Performance decisions are product decisions once users can feel them.

## link trail
This connects to [[Cached Chrome Top Million Websites]] and [[Log4Shell and the Ops Tax]] and [[Exchange Server Hacks]].

## open loop
Which performance costs are still hidden from product teams?
