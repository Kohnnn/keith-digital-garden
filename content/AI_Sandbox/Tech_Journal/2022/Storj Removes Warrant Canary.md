Storj removing its warrant canary signaled a shift in transparency posture. Even a small policy change becomes a trust signal in privacy-focused systems.

I read it as a governance moment. <span class="inline-claim">Silence can be a policy signal</span>.

## signals
- Warrant canaries are treated as trust guarantees.
- Policy changes become security narratives.
- Transparency posture affects adoption.
- Privacy services operate under legal uncertainty.

## my take
This is a reminder that privacy products live or die on credibility. If transparency slips, trust erodes faster than features can recover.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Transparency is a product feature.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Policy shifts are security events.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Legal pressure shapes public behavior.</li>
  <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Credibility is the moat.</li>
</ul>
