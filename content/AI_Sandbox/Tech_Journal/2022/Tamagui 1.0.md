# Tamagui 1.0

<div class="keyword-row">
  <span class="inline-keyword">react</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">ui</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">speed</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">crossplatform</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">tooling</span>
</div>

Tamagui 1.0 pitched cross-platform UI as a performance and speed advantage rather than a compromise. The release emphasized shared codebases without losing responsiveness.

I read it as a tooling consolidation trend. <span class="inline-claim">Performance is now a design constraint again</span>.

> What tradeoffs will teams accept to unify UI stacks?

## signals
- Cross-platform stacks aim for native performance.
- Tooling consolidates around shared UI primitives.
- Developer speed is now a strategic metric.
- Design systems become product infrastructure.

## my take
If the performance floor rises, cross-platform stacks become a default choice. The risk is lock-in, not latency.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Tooling is optimizing for speed and parity.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Consolidation can reduce flexibility.</li>
  <li><strong>Design:</strong> Shared primitives shape product identity.</li>
  <li><strong>Stack:</strong> UI is now infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
