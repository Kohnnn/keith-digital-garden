VanillaOS introduced an immutable approach to a familiar Linux base, positioning stability and rollback as core features. It hinted at a future where OS safety is the default.

I read it as a security posture shift. <span class="inline-claim">Immutability is a UX for trust</span>.

## signals
- Immutable systems move from servers to desktops.
- Rollbacks become a user expectation.
- Security posture is baked into OS design.
- Tooling is the bridge between safety and flexibility.

## my take
This feels like a push toward safer defaults. The real challenge will be preserving developer freedom without turning everything into containers.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Rollbacks increase confidence.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Security is now an OS selling point.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Immutability can slow experimentation.</li>
  <li><strong>Tooling:</strong> Good tools make safety usable.</li>
</ul>
