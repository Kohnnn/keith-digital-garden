The essay argued that Python keeps winning because it optimizes for iteration speed and ecosystem leverage. It framed tradeoffs as deliberate, not accidental.

I read it as a productivity signal. <span class="inline-note">Speed of thought beats raw performance for most work</span>.

## signals
- Ecosystem depth outweighs runtime cost.
- Developer iteration is a competitive advantage.
- Tradeoffs are often about team speed.
- Tooling stability drives language choice.

## my take
Most projects do not fail because of performance; they fail because of slow iteration and unclear feedback loops. Python optimizes for the latter.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Iteration beats optimization early.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Ecosystem depth wins adoption.</li>
  <li><strong>Tradeoff:</strong> Performance can be deferred.</li>
  <li><strong>Tooling:</strong> Stability equals productivity.</li>
</ul>
