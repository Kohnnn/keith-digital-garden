# apple emergency sos via satellite launches

*see also:* [[Product Positioning]] · [[Default Settings]]

Apple turned on Emergency SOS via satellite for iPhone 14 users in the US and Canada, letting phones link to Globalstar satellites for low-bandwidth distress texts ([Apple](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/11/iphone-users-can-now-text-emergency-services-via-satellite/)). Consumer radios now talk to space without extra hardware.

## scene cut
The feature walks users through pointing the phone at the sky, compresses data, and routes through Apple relay centers with trained responders translating short Q&A flows into rescue tickets.

## signal braid
- This is Apple’s most ambitious services-hardware hybrid since eSIM; it ties into the resilience themes in [[starlink public beta teases global broadband]].
- Emergency workflows now live inside iOS, a reminder that compute and infrastructure are converging.
- Carriers could lose leverage if Apple intermediates emergency communications.

## risk surface
- The feature still requires a clear sky; failure conditions could erode trust.
- Globalstar’s limited constellation means there’s a queue at peaks.
- Regulators will want reporting to ensure the relays handle life-or-death cases appropriately.

## my take
Apple solved a real user fear while flexing service integration muscle. It’s the purest example of locking customers into an ecosystem through baseline safety.

## ending questions
What new service will Apple graft onto this satellite link once enough users trust it?
