# apple lockdown mode preview

## scene cut
Apple previewed Lockdown Mode as a high-risk security profile aimed at users targeted by mercenary spyware ([source](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/07/apple-expands-commitment-to-protect-users-from-mercenary-spyware/)). It formalized a threat model into product.

## signal braid
- High-risk modes acknowledge real targeted threats.
- Security UX is now a first-class feature.
- Vendor responses shape the spyware economy.
- The posture aligns with [[NSO and the Entity List]].

## single-line take
Security features now map directly to threat models, not just settings.

## link hop
This links to [[NSO and the Entity List]] and [[Surveillance Normalized]] and [[Trust in Platforms]].

## open loop
How do we make high-security modes usable without hiding risk?

## updates
- 2025-02-17: Seed draft from 2022 backfill. Pending manual review.
