# apple m1 ultra

*see also:* [[Product Positioning]] · [[Default Settings]]

The M1 Ultra felt like a visibility event for Apple’s vertical stack. My read is that custom silicon is now the core product.

## scene cut
Apple announced the M1 Ultra, combining two M1 Max chips for higher performance ([source](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/03/apple-unveils-m1-ultra-the-worlds-most-powerful-chip-for-a-personal-computer/)). The move expanded the performance ceiling without switching architecture.

## signal braid
- Vertical integration is a durable performance lever.
- Custom silicon differentiates product lines.
- The chip roadmap is now Apple’s strategic edge.
- The hardware arc aligns with [[CHIPS Act Momentum]].

## single-line take
Silicon strategy is product strategy.

## my take
I think the key is control: Apple can tune hardware and software together, and that lets them move faster than platform peers.

## ending questions
How much of Apple’s edge is now locked into silicon design?
