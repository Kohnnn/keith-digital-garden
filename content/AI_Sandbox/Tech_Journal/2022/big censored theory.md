# big censored theory

## scene cut
A visual essay mapped patterns of censorship across media and time, using data art as analysis ([source](https://pudding.cool/2022/08/censorship/)). It made content moderation feel measurable.

## signal braid
- Visualization can reframe censorship debates.
- Data art makes policy questions legible.
- Patterns emerge when moderation is quantified.
- The governance thread aligns with [[Platform Accountability Cluster]].

## single-line take
Censorship debates change when you can see the pattern.

## link hop
This links to [[Platform Accountability Cluster]] and [[Trust in Platforms]] and [[Google Search Is Dying]].

## open loop
Which moderation metrics should platforms publish by default?

## updates
- 2025-02-28: Seed draft from 2022 backfill. Pending manual review.
