# bubbles interactive

## scene cut
The Bubbles demo visualized fluid motion in a way that felt tactile and immediate ([source](https://oimo.io/works/bubbles/)). It turned physics into a direct sensory experience.

## signal braid
- Small demos can teach complex motion.
- Visual fidelity drives learning intuition.
- Interaction compresses explanation time.
- The learning style matches [[Sound Interactive]].

## single-line take
A good demo can teach physics faster than a lecture.

## link hop
This links to [[Sound Interactive]] and [[Mechanical Watch Interactive]] and [[Draw SVG Rope Using JavaScript]].

## open loop
Which other physical systems deserve a playful demo?

## updates
- 2025-04-13: Seed draft from 2022 backfill. Pending manual review.
