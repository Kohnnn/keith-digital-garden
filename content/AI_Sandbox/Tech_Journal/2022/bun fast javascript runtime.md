# bun fast javascript runtime

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

## scene cut
Bun launched as a fast JavaScript runtime, bundler, and package manager written in Zig ([source](https://bun.sh/?launch)). It promised a unified, speed-first dev stack.

## signal braid
- Speed is a new selling point for toolchains.
- Consolidation reduces tooling sprawl.
- Runtime competition is heating up again.
- The stack ambition echoes [[deno 1.0]].

## single-line take
Toolchains are competing on speed and simplicity, not just features.

## link hop
This connects to [[deno 1.0]] and [[Why I'm Still Using Python]] and [[github codespaces]].

## open loop
Which parts of the JS stack are still the biggest performance bottlenecks?
