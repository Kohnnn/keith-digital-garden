# chaostron learning machines

## scene cut
A 1961 paper on learning machines resurfaced, reminding readers how early the field’s ideas appeared ([source](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/358027.358047)). It puts modern momentum in longer context.

## signal braid
- Old research frames current debates.
- The field cycles through familiar ideas.
- Historical context reduces hype distortion.
- The long view aligns with [[Claude Shannon Foundations of Communication]].

## single-line take
What looks new is often an old idea with faster hardware.

## link hop
This links to [[Claude Shannon Foundations of Communication]] and [[Whisper Open Source Speech Recognition]] and [[Dall-E 2]].

## open loop
Which old papers deserve a fresh read right now?
