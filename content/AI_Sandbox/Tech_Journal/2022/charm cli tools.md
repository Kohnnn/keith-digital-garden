# charm cli tools

I like when terminal tooling treats UX as serious design. It changes the feel of daily work.

## scene cut
Charm launched a suite of tools to make the command line more polished and expressive ([source](https://charm.sh/)). It positioned terminal UX as a product surface.

## signal braid
- CLI UX is now a design discipline.
- Developer tools compete on feel, not just function.
- Aesthetic polish can reduce friction.
- The workflow intent aligns with [[SD My Script Directory]].

## single-line take
Developer tools win when they feel good to use.

## my take
I think this is a quiet shift toward making the terminal a creative space, not just a utilitarian one. That matters for adoption and habit.

## ending questions
Which CLI tasks deserve a better UX layer?
