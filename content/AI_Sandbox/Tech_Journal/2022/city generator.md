# city generator

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

Procedural tools make cities feel like systems instead of artifacts. My read is that generators teach structure better than static maps.

## scene cut
A city generator tool created plausible street maps with a few clicks ([source](https://watabou.github.io/city-generator/)). It turned urban form into a programmable pattern.

## signal braid
- Procedural generation is a teaching tool.
- Maps become a design surface, not just a reference.
- Small tools can change mental models.
- The spatial workflow aligns with [[felt mapping tool]].

## single-line take
Generators teach structure by compressing cause and effect.

## link hop
This links to [[felt mapping tool]] and [[obsidian canvas]] and [[Compare Webb Images to Hubble]].

## my take
I think tools like this are valuable because they reveal the grammar behind complex systems. Once you see the grammar, you see the system.

## ending questions
Which other complex systems could be taught with generators?
