# design the next iphone

## scene cut
A playful web tool let users assemble their ideal iPhone, turning product tradeoffs into a game ([source](https://neal.fun/design-the-next-iphone/)). It showed how user priorities surface under constraint.

## signal braid
- Tradeoffs become visible when options are forced.
- Playful tools can reveal product demand.
- Feature prioritization is often about context.
- The UI insight echoes [[I Regret My Website Redesign]].

## single-line take
Play can be a research method when constraints are real.

## link hop
This links to [[I Regret My Website Redesign]] and [[Framework Laptop Upgrade]] and [[Pole Clock]].

## open loop
Which product categories could benefit from this kind of constraint tool?

## updates
- 2025-03-19: Seed draft from 2022 backfill. Pending manual review.
