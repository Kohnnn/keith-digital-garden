## scene cut
Nginx announced Igor Sysoev’s departure, marking a leadership transition for a core web server project ([source](https://www.nginx.com/blog/do-svidaniya-igor-thank-you-for-nginx/)). It highlighted how stewardship changes can ripple through infrastructure trust.

## signal braid
- Core infrastructure depends on stewardship continuity.
- Governance transitions shape ecosystem confidence.
- Leadership changes are risk events for critical stacks.
- The governance theme echoes [[Platform Accountability Cluster]].
