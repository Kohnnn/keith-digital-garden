# docker compose on windows hits certification notch

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

Docker announced Windows certification for Compose, promising consistent local dev with Linux server parity, linking to earlier cloud tooling transitions such as [[github codespaces preview surfaces cloud dev loop]].

## signal braid
- The certification ensures containers behave identically despite earlier Windows networking quirks noted in [[apple silicon m1 shakes pc industry]].
- It strengthens confidence for product teams that rely on consistent builds across Mac/Windows.

## my take
This lowers the friction barrier—DevOps can now share scripts without worrying about platform drift.

## ending questions
Which platforms still resist full parity with Linux?
