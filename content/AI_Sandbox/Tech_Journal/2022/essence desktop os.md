# essence desktop os

A from‑scratch desktop OS feels like a statement about control and coherence. My read is that it’s an attempt to make the stack legible again.

## scene cut
Essence documented the process of building a desktop operating system from scratch ([source](https://nakst.gitlab.io/essence)). It framed OS design as an end‑to‑end craft.

## signal braid
- OS design is still a viable learning frontier.
- Tight control enables coherent UX decisions.
- Building from scratch surfaces hidden assumptions.
- The spirit aligns with [[Write a Wayland Compositor]].

## single-line take
Sometimes the only way to understand a stack is to rebuild it.

## link hop
This links to [[Write a Wayland Compositor]] and [[VanillaOS]] and [[LineageOS 20]].

## my take
I think these projects matter because they make the invisible visible. Even if adoption is tiny, the ideas leak into the broader ecosystem.

## ending questions
Which parts of the OS stack still feel too opaque to most builders?
