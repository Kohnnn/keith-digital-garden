# felt mapping tool

*see also:* [[Product Positioning]] · [[Default Settings]]

## scene cut
Felt launched as a collaborative mapping tool with a focus on simple visual workflows ([source](https://felt.com/)). It treated maps as a coordination surface rather than a static output.

## signal braid
- Mapping tools are moving toward collaboration by default.
- Geodata UX is becoming a product differentiator.
- Visualization is now a core workflow layer.
- The spatial shift mirrors [[obsidian canvas]].

## single-line take
Maps are turning into shared canvases, not just charts.

## link hop
This links to [[obsidian canvas]] and [[State of HTTP in 2022]] and [[I Regret My Website Redesign]].

## open loop
Which teams benefit most when mapping becomes collaborative?
