# floppotron 3.0

## scene cut
Floppotron 3.0 used floppy drives and old hardware to perform music, blending engineering with performance ([source](http://silent.org.pl/home/2022/06/13/the-floppotron-3-0/)). It is a reminder that constraints can be musical.

## signal braid
- Old hardware can become new instruments.
- Playfulness keeps engineering culture alive.
- DIY builds create new audiences.
- The creative angle aligns with [[Riffusion Generates Music]].

## single-line take
Constraints turn into style when the builder leans in.

## link hop
This links to [[Riffusion Generates Music]] and [[Pockit Modular Computer]] and [[Advent of Code on a Playstation]].

## open loop
Which obsolete hardware could become a new instrument?

## updates
- 2025-02-27: Seed draft from 2022 backfill. Pending manual review.
