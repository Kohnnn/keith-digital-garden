# github copilot for business launches

GitHub launched Copilot for Business at $19/month per user, bundling SSO, policy toggles, and seat management around the AI autocomplete tool ([GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2022-12-07-copilot-for-business/)).

## scene cut
Organizations can now disable public code suggestions, enforce telemetry collection, and integrate Copilot with enterprise identity providers. GitHub also added features to block secrets and track acceptance rates.

## signal braid
- Enterprises that hesitated after [[GitHub Copilot Investigation]] now get governance knobs.
- MSFT is positioning Copilot as the norm for editors, accelerating the AI adoption curve similar to [[gpt-4 release recalibrates hallucination debate]].
- Developer metrics become more measurable because Copilot logs suggestion acceptance.

## risk surface
- AI-suggested code still inherits licensing risks; toggles help but don’t eliminate paranoia.
- Teams may rely on Copilot before setting standards, creating inconsistent style.
- GitHub now stores more metadata about developer keystrokes, raising privacy questions.

## my take
Copilot for Business turns AI pair programming from a curiosity into a budget line. Policy features lower the barrier for conservative teams.

## ending questions
What compliance proof will conservative industries demand before rolling Copilot across their repos?
