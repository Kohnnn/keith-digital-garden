# google tag manager anti adblock weapon

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

## scene cut
A technical analysis argued that Google Tag Manager can be used to bypass ad blockers and tracking defenses ([source](https://chromium.woolyss.com/f/HTML-Google-Tag-Manager-the-new-anti-adblock-weapon.html)). It framed tagging infrastructure as a surveillance layer.

## signal braid
- Tracking tooling evolves to bypass user defenses.
- Adtech arms races are now product features.
- Privacy expectations shift as evasion techniques spread.
- The surveillance arc matches [[Surveillance Normalized]].

## single-line take
The tracking stack is evolving faster than user protections.

## link hop
This links to [[Surveillance Normalized]] and [[Google Search Is Dying]] and [[Trust in Platforms]].

## open loop
What countermeasures actually scale against tag-based tracking?
