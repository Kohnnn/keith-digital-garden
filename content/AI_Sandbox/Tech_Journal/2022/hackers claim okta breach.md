# hackers claim okta breach

Identity providers are single points of failure; that’s the part that stuck with me. The claim itself mattered less than the systemic exposure it revealed.

## scene cut
Hackers claimed access to Okta systems, raising concerns about downstream customer exposure ([source](https://twitter.com/_MG_/status/1506109152665382920)). The incident put identity infrastructure under a spotlight.

## signal braid
- Identity providers are high‑leverage targets.
- Disclosure delays amplify trust damage.
- Cascading risk grows with federation.
- The incident echoes [[Exchange Server Hacks]].

## single-line take
When identity fails, everything inherits the blast radius.

## my take
I think the main risk is concentration. The more identities you centralize, the higher the stakes of any single compromise.

## ending questions
What identity architecture reduces systemic blast radius?
