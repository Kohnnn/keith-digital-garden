# i spent two years launching tiny projects

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

I spent two years launching tiny projects surfaced as a high-signal public thread and points to a broader shift in how builders respond to the current cycle ([source](https://tinyprojects.dev/posts/i_spent_two_years_launching_tiny_projects)). I see it as a hinge between immediate outcomes and longer-term incentives. The headline is not just the event but the behavior it reveals.

## context + claim
I spent two years launching tiny projects signals an engineering shift that will ripple through tooling and workflows. My claim: the technical change matters because it reshapes defaults more than it adds features.

## constraint map
- Adoption depends on integration cost, not just performance.
- Early gains are real but fragile without operational tooling.
- The ecosystem follows once compatibility becomes predictable.

## risk surface
- Over-rotation on the headline could mask second-order costs.
- Early adopters take execution risk while incumbents take narrative risk.
- If incentives misalign, the outcome becomes a short-lived spike instead of a durable shift.

## my take
I treat this as a directional signal, not a definitive answer. The right response is to adjust posture while keeping the option to reverse if the signal fades.
