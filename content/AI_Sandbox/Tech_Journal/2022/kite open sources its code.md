# kite open sources its code

Kite’s farewell felt like a reminder that tooling lifecycles are real. My read is that open-sourcing at the end is a trust repair move.

## scene cut
Kite announced it was shutting down and open‑sourcing its codebase ([source](https://www.kite.com/blog/product/kite-is-saying-farewell/)). The exit turned into a handoff rather than a hard stop.

## signal braid
- Tool sunsets are now expected lifecycle events.
- Open-sourcing can preserve community value.
- Trust depends on exit behavior, not just entry promises.
- The pattern aligns with [[sunsetting atom]].

## mini ledger
- cost: users lose a familiar workflow.
- benefit: codebase remains reusable.
- unknown: whether community can sustain it.

## link hop
This links to [[sunsetting atom]] and [[github codespaces]] and [[We Lost 54k GitHub Stars]].

## my take
I think the best exit is transparent and generous. If a tool is going to die, leaving the code behind is the closest thing to a graceful landing.

## ending questions
What should a responsible tooling shutdown include by default?
