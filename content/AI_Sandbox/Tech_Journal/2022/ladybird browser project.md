# ladybird browser project

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

I see new browser engines as a signal of web-stack diversity pressure. It’s not just about features; it’s about control of the rendering layer.

## scene cut
Ladybird launched as a new cross-platform browser project aiming to build its own engine ([source](https://awesomekling.github.io/Ladybird-a-new-cross-platform-browser-project/)). The project challenges the two‑engine dominance.

## signal braid
- Engine diversity reduces platform monoculture risk.
- New browsers test the limits of web compatibility.
- Tooling ecosystems cluster around rendering engines.
- The stack lens aligns with [[State of HTTP in 2022]].

## single-line take
Browser engines are governance infrastructure for the web.

## my take
I think the most valuable outcome is optionality. Even if adoption is small, a third engine changes how standards evolve.

## ending questions
What standards would change if a third engine gained real share?
