# new type of puzzle

## scene cut
A creator shared a new puzzle format with a physical-style grid and emergent patterns ([source](http://www.dogbunnypuzzle.com/)). The experiment framed puzzle design as interface design.

## signal braid
- Constraint design shapes player cognition.
- Physical metaphors make puzzles more legible.
- Novel formats can build new communities.
- The playfulness echoes [[Advent of Code on a Playstation]].

## single-line take
Puzzle design is a UI problem before it is a rules problem.

## link hop
This links to [[Advent of Code on a Playstation]] and [[Pockit Modular Computer]] and [[GameBoy Graphics Part 2 Tile Maps]].

## open loop
Which interface constraints create the most satisfying puzzles?
