# obsidian 1.0

The 1.0 label matters because it signals stability, not just features. I read it as a commitment to long-term workflows.

## scene cut
Obsidian released version 1.0, highlighting stability and a mature feature set ([source](https://obsidian.md/1.0)). The release positioned the app as a long-term knowledge home.

## signal braid
- Stability releases reduce workflow anxiety.
- Tool longevity is a product feature.
- Knowledge tools are competing on trust.
- The spatial layer connects to [[obsidian canvas]].

## single-line take
Knowledge tools win by staying boring and reliable.

## my take
I think 1.0 is a promise: you can invest years without replatforming. That promise is rare in this category, which is why it matters.

## ending questions
What signals make a knowledge tool feel safe to invest in?
