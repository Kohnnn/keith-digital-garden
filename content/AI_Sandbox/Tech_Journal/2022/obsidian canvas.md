# obsidian canvas

## scene cut
Obsidian announced Canvas as an infinite spatial workspace for ideas ([source](https://obsidian.md/canvas)). It framed note-taking as a visual coordination layer, not just text.

## signal braid
- Spatial layouts are now a first-class knowledge feature.
- Visual workflows complement linear notes.
- Tooling moves toward mixed‑media thinking.
- The shift aligns with [[RSS Brain]].

## single-line take

## link hop
This links to [[RSS Brain]] and [[SD My Script Directory]] and [[I Regret My Website Redesign]].

## open loop
