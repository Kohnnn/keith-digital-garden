# penpot open source design platform

*see also:* [[Product Positioning]] · [[Default Settings]]

Penpot feels like a reminder that design workflows do not have to be locked into a single vendor. My read is that openness is now a strategic differentiator for creative teams.

## scene cut
Penpot launched as an open-source design and prototyping platform with a browser-first workflow ([source](https://penpot.app/)). It positions design tools as a shared infrastructure layer rather than a closed product.

## signal braid
- Open tooling lowers vendor lock-in risk.
- Collaboration needs portability, not just features.
- Pricing leverage shifts when alternatives are credible.
- The market tension sits next to [[Adobe to Acquire Figma]].

## contrast seam
default read: niche open tool / counter read: leverage against consolidation.

## link hop
This links to [[Adobe to Acquire Figma]] and [[I Regret My Website Redesign]] and [[Platform Accountability Cluster]].

## my take
I think open design tools matter most for teams that need long‑term control of assets. If the tool owns the workflow, it owns the cost curve.

## ending questions
Which workflows are most exposed to vendor lock‑in right now?
