# portable secret

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

I like tools that make security portable without making it brittle. My read is that simplicity is the real safety feature.

## scene cut
Portable Secret demonstrated a compact workflow for storing and sharing secrets privately ([source](https://mprimi.github.io/portable-secret/)). It framed privacy as a transport problem.

## signal braid
- Portability reduces single‑device risk.
- Simplicity improves adoption of secure practices.
- Self‑contained workflows avoid platform lock‑in.
- The posture aligns with [[mullvad removes new subscriptions]].

## single-line take
If secure workflows are hard, people will not use them.

## link hop
This links to [[mullvad removes new subscriptions]] and [[apple end to end encryption for backups]] and [[Trust in Platforms]].

## my take
I think the best security tools hide complexity without hiding control. If a tool is too heavy, it becomes decorative.

## ending questions
What makes secret storage feel trustworthy without feeling heavy?
