# recursive game of life

This demo felt like a small portal into complexity. My read is that recursion makes systems more intuitive when the visuals are right.

## scene cut
An interactive demo showed a recursive Game of Life, stacking simulations within simulations ([source](https://oimo.io/works/life/)). It turned abstract recursion into a visual experience.

## signal braid
- Interactive demos compress complexity.
- Recursion is easier to grasp when it’s visible.
- Small experiments can teach deep ideas.
- The visual style aligns with [[bubbles interactive]].

## single-line take
Visualization is a shortcut to intuition.

## my take
I think these demos matter because they teach without requiring vocabulary. You can feel the system before you can name it.

## ending questions
Which other recursive systems deserve a visual translation?
