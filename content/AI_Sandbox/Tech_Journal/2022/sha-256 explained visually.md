# sha-256 explained visually

I like explanations that turn abstract crypto into something you can see. My read is that visualization is still underused in security education.

## scene cut
A visual walkthrough broke down SHA‑256 step by step ([source](https://sha256algorithm.com/)). It turned hashing into a sequence you can follow rather than a black box.

## signal braid
- Visuals lower the barrier to crypto literacy.
- Learning tools shape trust in security systems.
- Good explanations reduce misuse risk.
- The pedagogy connects to [[Sound Interactive]].

## fragment stack
hashing as motion
steps you can replay
math that stays human

## link hop
This links to [[Sound Interactive]] and [[Why SSH Keys Still Work After Byte Changes]] and [[Deceiving Windows Defender Big Stack Bypass]].

## my take
I think this kind of teaching prevents sloppy security assumptions. When you can see the steps, you stop treating hashes as magic.

## ending questions
Which other crypto primitives need visual teaching tools?
