# sunsetting atom

I read the Atom sunset as a reminder that tooling lifecycles are real even for beloved products. It felt like a governance choice more than a purely technical one.

## scene cut
GitHub announced it would sunset the Atom editor, citing focus on other projects ([source](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/)). The decision shifted developer workflows again.

## signal braid
- Tooling lifecycles are part of platform strategy.
- Community trust depends on transition paths.
- Editor choices shape daily productivity.
- The move connects to [[github codespaces]].

## single-line take
When a tool dies, a workflow dies with it.

## my take
I think the loss matters less than the migration path. If replacements are not obvious, people lose years of workflow comfort.

## ending questions
What makes a tooling sunset feel fair rather than abrupt?
