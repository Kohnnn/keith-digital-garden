# apple vision pro announcement blends xr and computing

*see also:* [[Product Positioning]] · [[Default Settings]]

Apple used WWDC to launch Vision Pro, a $3,499 headset with dual 4K micro-OLED displays, eye/hand tracking, and an external EyeSight display so outsiders see your gaze ([Apple](https://www.apple.com/vision-pro/)).

## scene cut
The headset runs visionOS, uses the M2 SoC plus a new R1 chip for sensor fusion, and integrates with existing Mac accessories. Apple pitched “spatial computing,” not VR/AR.

## signal braid
- Apple’s entry validates XR experiments like Meta’s haptics; see [[meta reality labs builds haptic glove prototype]].
- Eye tracking + pass-through compute will demand streaming pipelines similar to [[microsoft flight simulator streams entire planet]].
- The XR power draw forces use of external battery packs, highlighting energy constraints.

## risk surface
- Price limits adoption; developers may hesitate to build without a user base.
- Battery tether keeps sessions short (~2 hours).
- App ecosystem depends on iPad cross-compiles until native visionOS apps arrive.

## my take
Vision Pro is a moonshot that treats XR as the next general-purpose interface. Apple’s hardware is stellar, but the platform win depends on software and price curves.

## ending questions
What use cases justify Vision Pro’s price before Apple can ship a cheaper model?
