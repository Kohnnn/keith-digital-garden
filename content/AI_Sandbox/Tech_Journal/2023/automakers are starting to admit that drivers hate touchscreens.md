Automakers are starting to admit that drivers hate touchscreens frames a decision surface that keeps repeating across the stack ([source](https://slate.com/business/2023/04/cars-buttons-touchscreens-vw-porsche-nissan-hyundai.html)). I see it as a reminder that incentives, not features, do the heavy lifting. The rest is noise.

## context + claim
automakers are starting to admit that drivers hate touchscreens shifts the center of gravity toward a new default. My claim is simple: this is a habit-forming change, not a one-off event. If teams internalize the behavior, the market follows.

## constraint map
- Integration cost dominates adoption.
- Governance drag becomes the real bottleneck at scale.
- The easiest path wins, even when the best path is obvious.

## time horizon
Short term, this looks like a feature win. Mid term, it becomes a workflow expectation. Long term, it either hardens into a default or gets replaced by a quieter, more stable layer.

## my take
I am leaning cautious: treat the change as real, but do not calcify it until the operational story holds.
