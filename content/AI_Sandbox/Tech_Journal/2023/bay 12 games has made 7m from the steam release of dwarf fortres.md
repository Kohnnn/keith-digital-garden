Bay 12 Games has made $7M from the Steam release of Dwarf Fortress frames a decision surface that keeps repeating across the stack ([source](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=181354.0)). I see it as a reminder that incentives, not features, do the heavy lifting. The rest is noise.

## context + claim
bay 12 games has made $7m from the steam release of dwarf fortress shifts the center of gravity toward a new default. My claim is simple: this is a habit-forming change, not a one-off event. If teams internalize the behavior, the market follows.

## signal vs noise
- Signal: behavior that persists without marketing support.
- Signal: policy or tooling that narrows future choices.
- Noise: impressive demos without a maintenance story.

## risk surface
- The promise outruns operational reality.
- Costs shift from build to maintenance without warning.
- The narrative locks in before the evidence matures.

## my take
I am leaning cautious: treat the change as real, but do not calcify it until the operational story holds.
