- Noise: demos and commentary overstate production readiness.
- Noise: early excitement won’t survive the next budget cycle.
- Signal: the rollout path is designed for institutional buyers.

- The smallest edge-case in bazzite – a steamos-like oci image for desktop, living room, and handheld pcs becomes the largest reputational risk.
