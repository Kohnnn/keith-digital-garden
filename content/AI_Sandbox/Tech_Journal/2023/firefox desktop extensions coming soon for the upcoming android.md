Firefox desktop extensions coming soon for the upcoming Android release frames a decision surface that keeps repeating across the stack ([source](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2023/08/10/prepare-your-firefox-desktop-extension-for-the-upcoming-android-release/)). I see it as a reminder that incentives, not features, do the heavy lifting. The rest is noise.

## context + claim
firefox desktop extensions coming soon for the upcoming android release shifts the center of gravity toward a new default. My claim is simple: this is a habit-forming change, not a one-off event. If teams internalize the behavior, the market follows.

## evidence stack
- The visible change is only the surface; the incentive change is the durable part.
- Adoption pressure shows up before the tooling catches up, which creates short-term friction.
- The second-order effects are where I expect real compounding.

## decision boundary
If this lowers operational burden without a quality tradeoff, I treat it as a real shift. If it adds fragility or hidden cost, I treat it as a temporary spike.

## my take
I am leaning cautious: treat the change as real, but do not calcify it until the operational story holds.
