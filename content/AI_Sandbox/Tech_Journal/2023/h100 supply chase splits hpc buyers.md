# h100 supply chase splits hpc buyers

The H100 launch supply shortage became official as orders exceeded the available TSMC wafer slots, and buyers now wait months for allocations ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-h100-gpu-price-2023-05-22/)). Cloud users tap tokenized commitments while research labs scramble to find retailers.

## scene cut
Nvidia promised a billion-dollar quarter from H100, but the reality is complex allocations and reseller markups. The card is now a gating factor for new AI models.

## signal braid
- H100 scarcity matches the chip inventory story in [[chip inventory rebuild keeps fabs patient]], showing how even advanced nodes still swing between shortage and surplus.
- The chase increases compute concentration at hyperscalers, reminiscent of the Nvidia export story we already track in [[nvidia export limits reshape ai hardware race]].
- Cloud providers now bundle H100 as a premium tier, shifting cost modeling for enterprises.
- Research labs look back at [[alphafold 2 breaks protein folding logjam]] and realize their compute backlog will now stretch longer.

## risk surface
- Resellers selling at 2x list price threaten procurement protocols with ethical dilemmas.
- Startups without H100 access have to build with older cards, potentially missing the generative wave.
- Political pressure could force export controls similar to earlier hardware wars.

## linkage anchor
This note goes into the compute supply ledger and connects to [[nvidia ampere gpu reveal tightens datacenter race]] because H100 is the continuation of that story.

## my take
I now budget for compute procurement cycles rather than yearly refreshes; waiting lists dictate product release dates.

## ending questions
Will H100 scarcity push more workloads into custom accelerators or into competition for every wafer slot?
