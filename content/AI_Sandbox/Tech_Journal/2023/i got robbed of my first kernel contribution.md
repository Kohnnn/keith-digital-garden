I got robbed of my first kernel contribution is a pressure test for how this cycle behaves ([source](https://ariel-miculas.github.io/How-I-got-robbed-of-my-first-kernel-contribution/)). I track it because constraints show up before strategy does. The interesting part is what it makes feel inevitable.

## context + claim
i got robbed of my first kernel contribution shifts the center of gravity toward a new default. My claim: this is a habit-forming change, not a one-off event. If teams internalize the behavior, the market follows.

## constraint map
- Integration cost dominates adoption.
- Governance drag becomes the real bottleneck at scale.
- The easiest path wins, even when the best path is obvious.

## time horizon
Short term, this looks like a feature win. Mid term, it becomes a workflow expectation. Long term, it either hardens into a default or gets replaced by a quieter, more stable layer.

## my take
I am leaning cautious: treat the change as real, but do not calcify it until the operational story holds.
