This looks like a single event, but it behaves like a shift in defaults. The public narrative is clean; the operational tradeoffs are not ([source](https://aszx87410.github.io/beyond-xss/en/ch2/trust-types/)).

*see also:* [[Platform Risk]] · [[Latency Budget]]

## the seam
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[Platform Risk]] and [[Latency Budget]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## notes from the surface
- The path to adopt latest xss defense: trusted types and built-in sanitizer api looks smooth on paper but assumes alignment that rarely exists.
- The operational details around latest xss defense: trusted types and built-in sanitizer api matter more than the announcement cadence.
- The dependency chain around latest xss defense: trusted types and built-in sanitizer api is where risk accumulates, not at the surface.

## system motion
policy shift -> procurement changes -> roadmap narrows
surface change -> tooling adapts -> behavior hardens
constraint tightens -> teams standardize -> defaults calcify

## fault lines
- The smallest edge-case in latest xss defense: trusted types and built-in sanitizer api becomes the largest reputational risk.
- latest xss defense: trusted types and built-in sanitizer api amplifies integration debt faster than the value it returns.
- Governance drift turns tactical choices around latest xss defense: trusted types and built-in sanitizer api into strategic liabilities.

## my take
My stance is pragmatic: assume the shift is real, yet delay lock-in until the operational story settles.
