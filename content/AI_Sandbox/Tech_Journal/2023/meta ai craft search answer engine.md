# meta ai craft search answer engine

*see also:* [[LLMs]] · [[Model Behavior]]

Meta introduced AI-generated answers inside Facebook/Instagram search via Quest Pro promotion and announced an SGE-style feature to keep users within their walled garden ([Meta AI Search](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/05/meta-ai/)). The move shows they believe generative search is a defensive moat.

## scene cut
Meta's system uses internal knowledge graphs plus LLaMA variants to synthesize responses while linking to original content. The company also tries to invite creators to monetize the answers.

## signal braid
- The feature tracks the same competitive landscape as [[gpt-4 release recalibrates hallucination debate]], where accuracy and hallucination guardrails now differentiate each product.
- It also shares the platform concern of [[tiktok us ban chatter reorders content]]; any crackdown on algorithms now hits Meta more directly.
- The SGE race pushes Meta to invest in dataset curation, echoing themes from [[stable diffusion release makes open source ai art mainstream]].
- The technology is also a direct competitor to the GPT Store narrative in [[openai gpt store rewrites platform play]].

## risk surface
- If Meta's answer engine hallucinates, regulators may treat it as a misinformation vector.
- The product invites more scrutiny over data sourcing and advertising influence.
- It may cannibalize search ad revenue if generative answers keep users in-view but reduce clicking to referral sites.

## linkage anchor
This note ties into the broader generative search arms race and connects to the GPT compliance modules already in the vault.

## my take
Meta is trying to make generative AI a defensive shield rather than an offensive product; I’m watching how it balances trust with resurgence of algorithmic curation.

## ending questions
Will Meta treat generative answers as a new product line or just a defensive layer over existing services?
