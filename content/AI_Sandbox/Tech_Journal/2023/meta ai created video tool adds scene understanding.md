# meta ai created video tool adds scene understanding

Meta introduced an “AI Create” feature that analyzes video scenes to tag people, objects, and activities, enabling auto highlights and summaries inside Reels and Broadcast ([Meta](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/08/meta-ai-create-video/)).

## scene cut
The tool splits videos into shot segments, scores each shot for action, and generates captions plus suggested creative effects by referencing script prompts.

## signal braid
- Tools like this align with the creativity discourse from [[stable diffusion release makes open source ai art mainstream]].
- Scene understanding also feeds back into regulatory content checks mentioned in [[privacy tradeoffs in ai oversight]].
- It demonstrates Meta’s push to keep creators inside their platform while SaaS players consider API-first alternatives similar to [[openai gpt store rewrites platform play]].

## my take
Auto highlighter tech is the next frontier in media workflows. I now expect any video platform to include similar scene intelligence or risk ceding creators to Meta.

## ending questions
Which creative workflows will require human-in-the-loop oversight even as auto-highlighting matures?
