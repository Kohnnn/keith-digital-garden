# openai gpt store rewrites platform play

*see also:* [[LLMs]] · [[Model Behavior]]

OpenAI launched GPT Store, letting developers sell specialized agents, suggesting the model provider is embracing platform economics rather than pure API revenue ([OpenAI Blog](https://openai.com/newsroom/gpt-store/)). This move changes how we think about distribution and royalties.

## scene cut
The store curates copilots, enforces usage limits, and shares revenue with creators. It also includes an approval process for safety, meaning OpenAI now wields a gatekeeping role similar to the early Apple App Store.

## signal braid
- The storefront model echoes the monetization shift behind [[GitHub Copilot Investigation]]; both wrap AI into consumable products.
- It also ties into policy talk since the GPT Store complicates the EU AI Act's high-risk categorization when third parties control the prompts.
- Partner copilots must now worry about uptime and trust, tying back to the compliance emphasis in [[gpt-4 release recalibrates hallucination debate]].
- The store may shift traffic away from smaller API-only players, echoing the platform consolidation warnings seen in [[tiktok us ban chatter reorders content]].

## risk surface
- Revenue splits may disincentivize smaller creators due to narrow margins.
- OpenAI controls distribution, so there's no guaranteed neutrality for experimental tools.
- Safety review timelines could slow the introduction of new copilots.

## linkage anchor
This tech story tightens the loop between GPT milestones and policy/regulatory narratives, connecting to [[gpt-3 release redefines ai api calculus]] and [[eu ai act finalizes compliance timeline]].

## my take
The GPT Store is a bet that discovery matters more than raw API calls. I now think about user acquisition as a storefront problem, not just a developer outreach exercise.

## ending questions
Will OpenAI treat every GPT Store submission the same, or will the curation program shape corporate adoption more than the technology?
