Protomaps – A free and open source map of the world lands as a clean signal for the current cycle ([source](https://protomaps.com/)). The point is not the news itself but the behavioral drift it exposes. I care about what becomes default after the dust settles.

## context + claim
protomaps – a free and open source map of the world shifts the center of gravity toward a new default. My claim is simple: this is a habit-forming change, not a one-off event. If teams internalize the behavior, the market follows.

## evidence stack
- The visible change is only the surface; the incentive change is the durable part.
- Adoption pressure shows up before the tooling catches up, which creates short-term friction.
- The second-order effects are where I expect real compounding.

## decision boundary
If this lowers operational burden without a quality tradeoff, I treat it as a real shift. If it adds fragility or hidden cost, I treat it as a temporary spike.

## my take
I am leaning cautious: treat the change as real, but do not calcify it until the operational story holds.
