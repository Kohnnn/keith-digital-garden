Tesla recalls 360k vehicles, says full self-driving beta may cause crashes reads like a small event and a big signal at the same time ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/16/tesla-recalls-362758-vehicles-says-full-self-driving-beta-software-may-cause-crashes.html)). The point is not the headline, it is the behavioral drift it reveals. I care about what becomes default after the dust settles.

## context + claim
tesla recalls 360k vehicles, says full self-driving beta may cause crashes shifts the center of gravity toward a new default. My claim: this is a habit-forming change, not a one-off event. If teams internalize the behavior, the market follows.

## evidence stack
- The visible change is only the surface; the incentive change is the durable part.
- Adoption pressure shows up before the tooling catches up, which creates short-term friction.
- The second-order effects are where I expect real compounding.

## time horizon
Short term, this looks like a feature win. Mid term, it becomes a workflow expectation. Long term, it either hardens into a default or gets replaced by a quieter, more stable layer.

## my take
I am leaning cautious: treat the change as real, but do not calcify it until the operational story holds.
