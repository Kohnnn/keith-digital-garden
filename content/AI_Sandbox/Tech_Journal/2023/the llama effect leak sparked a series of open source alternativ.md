</div>

The LLama Effect: Leak Sparked a Series of Open Source Alternatives to ChatGPT frames a decision surface that keeps repeating across the stack ([source](https://thesequence.substack.com/p/the-llama-effect-how-an-accidental)). I see it as a reminder that incentives, not features, do the heavy lifting. The rest is noise.

## context + claim
the llama effect: leak sparked a series of open source alternatives to chatgpt shifts the center of gravity toward a new default. My claim is simple: this is a habit-forming change, not a one-off event. If teams internalize the behavior, the market follows.

## constraint map
- Integration cost dominates adoption.
- Governance drag becomes the real bottleneck at scale.
- The easiest path wins, even when the best path is obvious.

## time horizon
Short term, this looks like a feature win. Mid term, it becomes a workflow expectation. Long term, it either hardens into a default or gets replaced by a quieter, more stable layer.

## my take
I am leaning cautious: treat the change as real, but do not calcify it until the operational story holds.
