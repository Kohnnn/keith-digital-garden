I read fixing sleep-wake hangs on linux with amd gpus as a constraint signal more than novelty. The link is just the anchor; the mechanics are where the leverage is ([source](https://nyanpasu64.gitlab.io/blog/amdgpu-sleep-wake-hang/)).

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Compute Bottlenecks]]
## the seam
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[Latency Budget]] and [[Compute Bottlenecks]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## what i see
- The dependency chain around fixing sleep-wake hangs on linux with amd gpus is where risk accumulates, not at the surface.
- What looks like a surface change is actually a control move.
- The path to adopt fixing sleep-wake hangs on linux with amd gpus looks smooth on paper but assumes alignment that rarely exists.

## keep / ignore
- Signal: the rollout path is designed for institutional buyers.
- Signal: procurement and compliance are quietly shaping the outcome.
- Signal: incentives now favor stability over novelty.
- Noise: demos and commentary overstate production readiness.

## fragility
- fixing sleep-wake hangs on linux with amd gpus amplifies supply friction faster than the value it returns.
- Governance drift turns tactical choices around fixing sleep-wake hangs on linux with amd gpus into strategic liabilities.
- The smallest edge case in fixing sleep-wake hangs on linux with amd gpus becomes the largest reputational risk.

## my take
This is a boundary note for me. I’ll track it as a trend, not a one off.

## ending questions
What would make this default unwind instead of harden?
