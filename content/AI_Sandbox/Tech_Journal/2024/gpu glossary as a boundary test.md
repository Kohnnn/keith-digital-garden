# gpu glossary as a boundary test

This looks like a single event, but it behaves like a shift in defaults. The public narrative is clean; the operational tradeoffs are not ([source](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary)).

*see also:* [[Compute Bottlenecks]] · [[Platform Risk]]
## why this matters
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[Compute Bottlenecks]] and [[Platform Risk]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## clues
- The path to adopt gpu glossary looks smooth on paper but assumes alignment that rarely exists.
- The first order win is clarity; the second order cost is optionality.
- The way gpu glossary is framed compresses complexity into a single promise.

## signal braid
- Signal: incentives now favor stability over novelty.
- Noise: early excitement won’t survive the next budget cycle.
- Signal: procurement and compliance are quietly shaping the outcome.
- Signal: the rollout path is designed for institutional buyers.

## time horizon
Short term, this looks like a capability win. Mid term, it becomes a budgeting and compliance question. Long term, the dominant path is whichever reduces coordination cost.

## my take
I see this as a real signal with a short half life. Move fast, but don’t calcify.

## ending questions
Which constraint would need to loosen for this to reverse?
