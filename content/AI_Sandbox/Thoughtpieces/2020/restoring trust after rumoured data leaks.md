# restoring trust after rumoured data leaks

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

Rumours of leaks hurt more than actual breaches; people now demand audit trails similar to the zero trust need in [[privacy tradeoffs in ai oversight]].

## signal braid
- Trust stories are consistent with [[social cooling]] and with competitor reliability debates like [[zoom security meltdown exposes cryptography gaps]].

## my take
Transparency about rumours is as critical as transparency about facts.

## ending questions
How do teams communicate before confirmation without fueling panic?
