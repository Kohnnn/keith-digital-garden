# slack is a luxury in supply chains

Port backlogs in 2020 made me realize we built logistics systems that assume zero buffer. Every ship that waited off LA was a reminder that slack equals survival.

## context + claim
Efficiency fetishism gutted redundancy. When [[Port Congestion Squeeze]] hit, we had no flex—no extra cranes, no spare containers, no workforce reserves.

## risk surface
- Lean inventories sound smart until a single week of delays ripples through retail.
- Financial incentives still reward “turns” over resilience.
- Governments only notice supply chains when they break, making policy reactive.

## my take
I now evaluate vendors by their slack. Any partner that can’t prove surge capacity is a risk, no matter their price.

## ending questions
What slack metrics should procurement teams demand before they sign multi-year contracts?
