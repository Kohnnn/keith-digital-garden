# zero trust is still one-hop away

Despite frameworks, most deployments rely on a single identity decision, meaning the risk persists as seen in [[zoom security meltdown exposes cryptography gaps]].

## analysis modules
- Risk remains until identity is distributed across sensors (see [[okta breach fallout highlights identity fragility]]).
- Policy draws from the cyber insurance tensions in [[cyber insurance premiums stay sticky despite claims]].

## my take
I treat zero trust as a journey; each hop adds coverage.

## ending questions
What’s the next hop beyond identity?
