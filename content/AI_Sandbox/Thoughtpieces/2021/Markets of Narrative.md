# markets of narrative

<div class="keyword-row">
  <span class="inline-keyword">markets</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">narrative</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">trust</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">volatility</span>
  <span class="inline-keyword">capital</span>
</div>

2021 made it hard to separate stories from prices. Meme stocks, crypto swings, and sudden IPO surges showed that attention can move capital faster than fundamentals. The market became a narrative engine.

I read this as a trust cycle. When stories dominate, pricing becomes more about belief than data. <span class="inline-claim">Narrative is a liquidity force</span>.

The risk is that narratives reverse quickly, and that reversal is always faster than institutional response.

## signals
- Attention drives price discovery in thin markets.
- Narrative reversals amplify volatility.
- Capital flows follow story momentum.
- Trust becomes a price input.
- Fundamentals lose timing power in hype cycles.

## my take
The market is always a story, but 2021 made that story louder than usual. The lesson is to watch narratives as real signals, not noise.

<ul class="brain-dump">
  <li><strong>Attention:</strong> Visibility creates liquidity.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Narrative reversals are violent.</li>
  <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Belief is priced in faster than facts.</li>
  <li><strong>Cycle:</strong> Hype has a short shelf life.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Stories are market data now.</li>
</ul>
