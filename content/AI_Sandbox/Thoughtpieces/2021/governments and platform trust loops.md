# governments and platform trust loops

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

Every regulatory dialogue after outages (see [[Fastly and the Edge Outage]]) resets the trust contract between governments and platforms.

## signal braid
- The trust loop echoes the panel debates in [[open banking trust debates spurs regulation]].
- It also mirrors identity trust seen in [[okta breach fallout highlights identity fragility]].

## my take
I now map regulatory conversations as part of platform roadmaps.

## linkage

## ending questions
Will trust loops become predictable frameworks or reactive scrums?
