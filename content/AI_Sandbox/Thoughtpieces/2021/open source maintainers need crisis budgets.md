# open source maintainers need crisis budgets

Watching unpaid volunteers triage Log4Shell patches made me realize we keep gambling on goodwill in places where we’d never accept unpaid labor.

## context + claim
Critical packages now power energy, finance, hospitals—yet maintainer teams are tiny. We need budgets, not tip jars.

## signal vs noise
- Signal: companies that rushed to patch Log4Shell now write security memos; they should also write checks.
- Noise: PR-friendly bug bounty pools do nothing for long-term maintenance.
- Signal: the same fragility showed up when [[zoom security meltdown exposes cryptography gaps]] forced trust resets.

## my take
Maintainer burnout is a systemic risk. I want crisis budgets embedded into procurement so the people holding the stack together have actual runway.

## ending questions
How do we formalize funding for maintainers before the next zero-day exposes our complacency?
