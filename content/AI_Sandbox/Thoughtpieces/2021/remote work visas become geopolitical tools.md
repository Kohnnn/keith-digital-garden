# remote work visas become geopolitical tools

*see also:* [[Product Positioning]] · [[Default Settings]]

Nations compete for remote workers by inventing long-stay visas, echoing the geopolitical toolkit seen in [[g7 price cap gambit targets russian revenue]] but with talent strategies.

## signal braid
- Visa perks boost digital services exports, which parallels the energy export manipulations around [[nord stream 1 shutdown cements europe gas crunch]].
- Governments now include these visas in economic diplomacy talks similar to [[ukraine grain corridor restarts black sea exports]].

## my take
Remote work shackles now compete with trade wars. I treat visa policies as strategic levers when choosing headquarters.
