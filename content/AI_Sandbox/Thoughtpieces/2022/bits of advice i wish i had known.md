# bits of advice i wish i had known

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

I read the list as a catalog of tradeoffs rather than a set of rules. My take is that the value is in pattern recognition, not compliance.

## scene cut
Kevin Kelly published a list of lessons framed as practical advice ([source](https://kk.org/thetechnium/103-bits-of-advice-i-wish-i-had-known/)). The list functions more like a map than a checklist.

## signal braid
- Advice becomes useful when it names tradeoffs.
- Timing matters more than accuracy for many lessons.
- Lists create reflection prompts, not instructions.
- The framing echoes [[Work Without a Center]].

## contrast seam
default read: rules to follow / counter read: prompts to revisit.

## my take
I think the best use is to pick three lines that create friction with your current habits. The friction is the signal.

## linkage

  </ul>
</div>

## ending questions
Which three lessons still feel wrong but probably true?
