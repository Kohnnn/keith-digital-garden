# climate anxiety pushes infra teams into scenario planning

When Europe’s rivers fell and the US grid strained last summer, operations teams I work with started running tabletop exercises about heat, drought, and floods. Anxiety flipped into scenario planning.

## context + claim
Boards now demand climate stress tests the way banks stress liquidity. It’s the same mental shift that followed [[nord stream 1 shutdown cements europe gas crunch]]—infrastructure suddenly felt fragile.

## constraint map
- Data is messy: local weather and grid availability aren’t easy to fetch.
- People are the bottleneck; few engineers know both climate science and infra operations.
- Scenario drills cost time, and budgets remain flat.

## my take
I treat climate anxiety as a leading indicator. When teams worry, they plan—and planning buys time when the next shock hits.

## ending questions
How often should infrastructure leaders run climate scenario drills before it becomes performative?
