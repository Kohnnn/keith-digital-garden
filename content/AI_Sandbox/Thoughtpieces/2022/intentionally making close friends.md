# intentionally making close friends

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

The piece lands because it treats friendship as a design problem, not a lucky accident. My read is that closeness is built through repeated, intentional systems.

## scene cut
A long essay outlined practices for building close friendships in adulthood ([source](https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/43-making-friends)). It reframed social connection as something you can actively engineer.

## signal braid
- Adult friendships decay without scheduled time.
- Intentionality is a counter to drift.
- Community design matters as much as personality.
- The pattern aligns with [[Work Without a Center]].

## single-line take
Friendship scales with intention, not proximity.

## my take
I think the strongest idea is that closeness is a maintenance system. If it isn’t in the calendar, it disappears.
