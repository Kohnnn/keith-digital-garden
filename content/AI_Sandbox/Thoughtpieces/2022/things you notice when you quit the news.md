# things you notice when you quit the news

The piece felt like a pressure release valve. My read is that the cost of constant updates is less about knowledge and more about nervous system load.

## scene cut
A reflective essay listed the shifts noticed after quitting the news cycle ([source](https://www.raptitude.com/2016/12/five-things-you-notice-when-you-quit-the-news/)). It framed information intake as a habit with consequences.

## signal braid
- News intake can feel like vigilance, not learning.
- Anxiety often drops before curiosity returns.
- Curation can preserve signal, see [[RSS Brain]].
- The cycle mirrors [[Surviving Disillusionment]].

## single-line take
Sometimes the best filter is absence.

## my take
I think the real trick is to replace the stream with intention. If the input remains reactive, the output stays reactive.

## linkage

  </ul>
</div>

## ending questions
What’s the smallest input change that reduces anxiety the most?
