# why do you waste so much time on the internet

The essay landed for me because it treats attention loss as a system, not a personal failure. My read is that the interface shapes the habit before the habit feels like a choice.

## scene cut
A personal essay asked why we lose so much time online and pointed to small default loops that trap attention ([source](https://zan.bearblog.dev/why-i-waste-time/)). It framed distraction as a design outcome.

## signal braid
- Defaults create habits faster than intentions.
- Attention loss compounds through small loops.
- Curation is a real counter‑strategy, see [[RSS Brain]].
- Trust in discovery affects drift, see [[Google Search Is Dying]].

## contrast seam
default read: weak will / counter read: engineered loops.

## my take
I think the exit ramps matter more than the warnings. If the product makes exit expensive, the user will stay. Design is the lever, not motivation.

## ending questions
What UI defaults would actually help people leave?
