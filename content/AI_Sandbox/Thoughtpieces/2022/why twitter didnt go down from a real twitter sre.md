# why twitter didn’t go down: from a real twitter sre

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

Why Twitter didn’t go down: From a real Twitter SRE surfaced as a high-signal public thread and points to a broader shift in how builders respond to the current cycle ([source](https://matthewtejo.substack.com/p/why-twitter-didnt-go-down-from-a)). I see it as a hinge between immediate outcomes and longer-term incentives. The headline is not just the event but the behavior it reveals.

## context + claim
This reads as a cultural signal wrapped in why twitter didn’t go down: from a real twitter sre, not just a news item. My claim: we are watching a shift in narrative power, where the story people tell about the work becomes the work.

## counter-model
The other read is that this is a minor episode with no lasting structural impact. That argument is plausible, but it ignores the way small stories accumulate and set expectations. I treat it as a narrative hinge until proven otherwise.

## risk surface
- Over-rotation on the headline could mask second-order costs.
- Early adopters take execution risk while incumbents take narrative risk.
- If incentives misalign, the outcome becomes a short-lived spike instead of a durable shift.

## my take
I treat this as a directional signal, not a definitive answer. The right response is to adjust posture while keeping the option to reverse if the signal fades.
