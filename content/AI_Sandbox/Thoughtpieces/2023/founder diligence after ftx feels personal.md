# founder diligence after ftx feels personal

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

Every conversation with a potential partner now includes questions about custody, commingled accounts, and tone from the top. FTX taught us that spreadsheets aren’t enough; we now evaluate character like it’s a KPI.

## context + claim
The SVB crisis reinforced this shift—depositor trust disappeared overnight (see [[svb collapse rewrites depositor trust]]). So now we inspect founders’ personal security habits, liquidity plans, and governance.

## signal braid
- Signal: VCs ask for third-party custody statements even in seed rounds.
- Signal: exec hiring includes background checks on personal leverage.
- Noise: conspiracy theories about every founder hide the real diligence work.

## my take
I welcome this nosiness. If you handle customer funds, you should expect financial therapy sessions before anyone wires money.

## ending questions
What level of personal transparency should we expect from founders before trusting them with customer assets?
