# heat waves teach logistics humility

When 2023's summer heat broke records across Europe and North America, rail sinuousness, warehouse cooling failures, and drayage issues reminded me that physical networks are as sensitive as financial ones.

## signal vs noise
- Signal: rail bars expand in heat, causing speed restrictions and backlogs, which I linked to [[diesel inventories slip to crisis lows in us]] because both reflect energy chain stress.
- Noise: Weather chatter on social feeds distracts from structural planning; the real question is how to build thermal buffers.
- Signal: the climate also affects crew availability, connecting to [[us rail strike averted by tentative labor deal]].

## risk surface
- Warehouses without active cooling risk product spoilage during heat waves.
- Crew availability drops when extreme heat sends employees home for safety.
- Fuel use spikes, straining both energy grids and trucking budgets.

## my take
Climate is not a background condition anymore; it's a real-time pressure variable in logistics models, and ignoring it is irresponsible.

## ending questions
What temperature buffer should logistics planners bake into every rail and warehouse contract?
