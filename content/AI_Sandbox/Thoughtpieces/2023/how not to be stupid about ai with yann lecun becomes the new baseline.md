When how not to be stupid about ai, with yann lecun hit, the obvious story was the headline. The less obvious story is the boundary it moves. I’m using the source as a reference point, not a full explanation ([source](https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-meta-yann-lecun-interview/)).

*see also:* [[LLMs]] · [[Compute Bottlenecks]]

## set-up
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[LLMs]] and [[Compute Bottlenecks]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## observables
- The first-order win is clarity; the second-order cost is optionality.
- The path to adopt how not to be stupid about ai, with yann lecun looks smooth on paper but assumes alignment that rarely exists.
- What looks like a surface change is actually a control move.

## how it cascades
constraint tightens -> teams standardize -> defaults calcify
policy shift -> procurement changes -> roadmap narrows
surface change -> tooling adapts -> behavior hardens

## duration
Short term, this looks like a capability win. Mid term, it becomes a budgeting and compliance question. Long term, the dominant path is whichever reduces coordination cost.

## my take
I’m leaning toward treating this as structural. Build for the default that’s forming, but keep an exit path.
