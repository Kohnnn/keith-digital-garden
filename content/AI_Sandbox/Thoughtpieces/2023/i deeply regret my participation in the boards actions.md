I deeply regret my participation in the board's actions is a pressure test for how this cycle behaves ([source](https://twitter.com/ilyasut/status/1726590052392956028)). I track it because constraints show up before strategy does. The interesting part is what it makes feel inevitable.

## context + claim
i deeply regret my participation in the board's actions shifts the center of gravity toward a new default. My claim: this is a habit-forming change, not a one-off event. If teams internalize the behavior, the market follows.

## causal chain
Trigger -> workflow adjustment -> new default, because habits are stickier than roadmaps.
New default -> platform leverage -> narrowing options for smaller teams.

## counter-model
The skeptical read is that this fades as soon as attention moves. That is plausible, but I keep watching whether teams encode it into their routines. Routines are the actual signal.

## my take
I am leaning cautious: treat the change as real, but do not calcify it until the operational story holds.
