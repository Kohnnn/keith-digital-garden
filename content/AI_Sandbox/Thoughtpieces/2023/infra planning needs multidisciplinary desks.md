# infra planning needs multidisciplinary desks

Every infrastructure bet now reads like a multi-threat puzzle—energy, climate, geopolitics—so a single-silo operations team cannot cover it all.

## signal braid
- Supply caution echoes [[supply chain issues killing synth companies]] and [[chipmakers eye hungary for fab expansion]].
- Climate-driven scenarios (see [[climate anxiety pushes infra teams into scenario planning]]) now compete with data residency (see [[data rights become ai infrastructure]]).
- Cyber insurance trends (see [[cyber insurance premiums stay sticky despite claims]]) also demand security input during planning.

## my take
I now build infrastructure boards with legal, data, and physical ops experts at the same table; otherwise hidden risks slip through.

## ending questions
How do you structure incentives so multidisciplinary desks share accountability for long-term risk?
