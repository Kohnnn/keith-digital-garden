OpenAI's employees were given two explanations for why Sam Altman was fired is a reminder that the smallest shifts in defaults can carry the largest consequences ([source](https://www.businessinsider.com/openais-employees-given-explanations-why-sam-altman-out-2023-11)). The visible change is just the entry point.

## context + claim
openai's employees were given two explanations for why sam altman was fired shifts the center of gravity toward a new default. My claim: this is a habit-forming change, not a one-off event. If teams internalize the behavior, the market follows.

## causal chain
Trigger -> workflow adjustment -> new default, because habits are stickier than roadmaps.
New default -> platform leverage -> narrowing options for smaller teams.

## counter-model
The skeptical read is that this fades as soon as attention moves. That is plausible, but I keep watching whether teams encode it into their routines. Routines are the actual signal.

## my take
I am leaning cautious: treat the change as real, but do not calcify it until the operational story holds.
