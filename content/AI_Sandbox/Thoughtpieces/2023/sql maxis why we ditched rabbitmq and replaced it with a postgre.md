SQL Maxis: Why We Ditched RabbitMQ and Replaced It with a Postgres Queue reads like a small event and a big signal at the same time ([source](https://www.prequel.co/blog/sql-maxis-why-we-ditched-rabbitmq-and-replaced-it-with-a-postgres-queue)). The point is not the headline, it is the behavioral drift it reveals. I care about what becomes default after the dust settles.

## context + claim
sql maxis: why we ditched rabbitmq and replaced it with a postgres queue shifts the center of gravity toward a new default. My claim: this is a habit-forming change, not a one-off event. If teams internalize the behavior, the market follows.

## constraint map
- Integration cost dominates adoption.
- Governance drag becomes the real bottleneck at scale.
- The easiest path wins, even when the best path is obvious.

## time horizon
Short term, this looks like a feature win. Mid term, it becomes a workflow expectation. Long term, it either hardens into a default or gets replaced by a quieter, more stable layer.

## my take
I am leaning cautious: treat the change as real, but do not calcify it until the operational story holds.
