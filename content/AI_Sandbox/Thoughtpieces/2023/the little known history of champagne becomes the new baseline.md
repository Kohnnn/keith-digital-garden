The headline makes it feel settled. It isn’t. the little-known history of champagne is moving the line on what people accept as normal, and that is the part I care about ([source](https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20230301-the-little-known-history-of-champagne)).

## why this matters
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[Platform Risk]] and [[Reliability Debt]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## field notes
- The dependency chain around the little-known history of champagne is where risk accumulates, not at the surface.
- What looks like a surface change is actually a control move.
- The operational details around the little-known history of champagne matter more than the announcement cadence.

## what to watch
- Noise: demos and commentary overstate production readiness.
- Signal: incentives now favor stability over novelty.
- Signal: procurement and compliance are quietly shaping the outcome.
- Noise: early excitement won’t survive the next budget cycle.

## risk surface
- Governance drift turns tactical choices around the little-known history of champagne into strategic liabilities.
- the little-known history of champagne amplifies integration debt faster than the value it returns.
- The smallest edge-case in the little-known history of champagne becomes the largest reputational risk.

## my take
I’m leaning toward treating this as structural. Build for the default that’s forming, but keep an exit path.

## ending questions
If the incentives flipped, what would stay sticky?
