Theory-building and why employee churn is lethal to software companies reads like a small event and a big signal at the same time ([source](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2022/theory-building/)). The point is not the headline, it is the behavioral drift it reveals. I care about what becomes default after the dust settles.

## context + claim
theory-building and why employee churn is lethal to software companies shifts the center of gravity toward a new default. My claim: this is a habit-forming change, not a one-off event. If teams internalize the behavior, the market follows.

## causal chain
Trigger -> workflow adjustment -> new default, because habits are stickier than roadmaps.
New default -> platform leverage -> narrowing options for smaller teams.

## counter-model
The skeptical read is that this fades as soon as attention moves. That is plausible, but I keep watching whether teams encode it into their routines. Routines are the actual signal.

## my take
I am leaning cautious: treat the change as real, but do not calcify it until the operational story holds.
