# web3 energy ethics return

*see also:* [[Latency Budget]] · [[Platform Risk]]

With Ethereum fully proof-of-stake and new chains touting minimal consumption, I notice the narrative loop back to ethics—the same concerns that fueled [[global carbon budget 2020 rebound warning]].

## context + claim
Proof-of-stake lowered emissions, but the hype now pushes new layer-1s to claim carbon neutrality without standards. Ethics has returned as a primary design constraint, not just marketing.

## signal braid
- The adoption of proof-of-stake counters the lavish electricity debates from [[GPU shortage hits gamers and miners]].
- Chainalysis data on crime (see [[chainalysis 2023 crypto crime report]]) adds pressure because energy-intensive operations now look more suspicious.

## my take
I evaluate blockchains by both consensus and the rigor of their energy accounting. Tokenomics no longer include only emissions but also transparency.

## ending questions
What third-party audits could prove a chain’s energy claims before investors pile back in?
