Why does a plastic-wrapped turkey sandwich cost $15 at the NYC airport? is a pressure test for how this cycle behaves ([source](https://hellgatenyc.com/why-is-airport-turkey-sandwich-expensive)). I care less about the headline and more about the constraints it reveals. The interesting part is what defaults this makes feel inevitable.

## context + claim
why does a plastic-wrapped turkey sandwich cost $15 at the nyc airport? shifts the center of gravity toward a new default. My claim is simple: this is a habit-forming change, not a one-off event. If teams internalize the behavior, the market follows.

## signal vs noise
- Signal: behavior that persists without marketing support.
- Signal: policy or tooling that narrows future choices.
- Noise: impressive demos without a maintenance story.

## risk surface
- The promise outruns operational reality.
- Costs shift from build to maintenance without warning.
- The narrative locks in before the evidence matures.

## my take
I am leaning cautious: treat the change as real, but do not calcify it until the operational story holds.
