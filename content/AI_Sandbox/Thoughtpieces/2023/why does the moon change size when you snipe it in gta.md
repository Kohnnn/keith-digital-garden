Why does the moon change size when you snipe it in GTA? frames a decision surface that keeps repeating across the stack ([source](https://insiderockstarnorth.blogspot.com/2023/11/why-does-moon-change-size-when-you.html)). I see it as a reminder that incentives, not features, do the heavy lifting. The rest is noise.

## context + claim
why does the moon change size when you snipe it in gta? shifts the center of gravity toward a new default. My claim is simple: this is a habit-forming change, not a one-off event. If teams internalize the behavior, the market follows.

## causal chain
Trigger -> workflow adjustment -> new default, because habits are stickier than roadmaps.
New default -> platform leverage -> narrowing options for smaller teams.

## counter-model
The skeptical read is that this fades as soon as attention moves. That is plausible, but I keep watching whether teams encode it into their routines. Routines are the actual signal.

## my take
I am leaning cautious: treat the change as real, but do not calcify it until the operational story holds.
