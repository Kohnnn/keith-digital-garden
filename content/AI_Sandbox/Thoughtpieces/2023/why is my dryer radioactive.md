Why is my dryer radioactive? frames a decision surface that keeps repeating across the stack ([source](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/764460/why-is-my-dryer-radioactive)). I see it as a reminder that incentives, not features, do the heavy lifting. The rest is noise.

## context + claim
why is my dryer radioactive? shifts the center of gravity toward a new default. My claim is simple: this is a habit-forming change, not a one-off event. If teams internalize the behavior, the market follows.

## constraint map
- Integration cost dominates adoption.
- Governance drag becomes the real bottleneck at scale.
- The easiest path wins, even when the best path is obvious.

## time horizon
Short term, this looks like a feature win. Mid term, it becomes a workflow expectation. Long term, it either hardens into a default or gets replaced by a quieter, more stable layer.

## my take
I am leaning cautious: treat the change as real, but do not calcify it until the operational story holds.
