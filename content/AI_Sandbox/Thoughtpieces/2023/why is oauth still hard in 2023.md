Why is OAuth still hard in 2023? is a pressure test for how this cycle behaves ([source](https://www.nango.dev/blog/why-is-oauth-still-hard)). I track it because constraints show up before strategy does. The interesting part is what it makes feel inevitable.

## context + claim
why is oauth still hard in 2023? shifts the center of gravity toward a new default. My claim: this is a habit-forming change, not a one-off event. If teams internalize the behavior, the market follows.

## evidence stack
- The visible change is only the surface; the incentive change is the durable part.
- Adoption pressure shows up before the tooling catches up, which creates short-term friction.
- The second-order effects are where I expect real compounding.

## time horizon
Short term, this looks like a feature win. Mid term, it becomes a workflow expectation. Long term, it either hardens into a default or gets replaced by a quieter, more stable layer.

## my take
I am leaning cautious: treat the change as real, but do not calcify it until the operational story holds.
