Why was Roman concrete so durable? is a reminder that the smallest shifts in defaults can carry the largest consequences ([source](https://news.mit.edu/2023/roman-concrete-durability-lime-casts-0106)). The visible change is just the entry point.

## context + claim
why was roman concrete so durable? shifts the center of gravity toward a new default. My claim: this is a habit-forming change, not a one-off event. If teams internalize the behavior, the market follows.

## constraint map
- Integration cost dominates adoption.
- Governance drag becomes the real bottleneck at scale.
- The easiest path wins, even when the best path is obvious.

## time horizon
Short term, this looks like a feature win. Mid term, it becomes a workflow expectation. Long term, it either hardens into a default or gets replaced by a quieter, more stable layer.

## my take
I am leaning cautious: treat the change as real, but do not calcify it until the operational story holds.
