# process philosophy and the cost of defaults

<div class="inline-ref">
  <span class="inline-note">ref</span>
  <a class="ref-link external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_philosophy" rel="nofollow"><span class="indicator-hook"></span>en.wikipedia.org</a>
  <span class="ref-title">Process Philosophy</span>

</div>

This looks like a single event, but it behaves like a shift in defaults. The public narrative is clean; the operational tradeoffs are not ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_philosophy)).

*see also:* [[Model Behavior]] · [[Compute Bottlenecks]]
## why this matters
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[Model Behavior]] and [[Compute Bottlenecks]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## clues
- What looks like a surface change is actually a control move.
- The way process philosophy is framed compresses complexity into a single promise.
- The dependency chain around process philosophy is where risk accumulates, not at the surface.

## causal chain
surface change -> tooling adapts -> behavior hardens
constraint tightens -> teams standardize -> defaults calcify
policy shift -> procurement changes -> roadmap narrows

## duration
Short term, this looks like a capability win. Mid term, it becomes a budgeting and compliance question. Long term, the dominant path is whichever reduces coordination cost.

## my take
My stance is pragmatic: assume the shift is real, yet delay lock in until the operational story settles.
