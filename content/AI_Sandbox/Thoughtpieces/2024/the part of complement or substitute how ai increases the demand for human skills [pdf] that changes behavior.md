I read complement or substitute? how ai increases the demand for human skills [pdf] as a constraint signal more than novelty. The link is just the anchor; the mechanics are where the leverage is ([source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19754)).

*see also:* [[Compute Bottlenecks]] · [[Model Behavior]]
## ground truth
The visible change is obvious; the deeper change is the permission it creates. I read this as a reset in expectations for teams like [[Compute Bottlenecks]] and [[Model Behavior]]. Once expectations shift, the fallback path becomes the policy.

## observables
- The way complement or substitute? how ai increases the demand for human skills [pdf] is framed compresses complexity into a single promise.
- What looks like a surface change is actually a control move.
- The dependency chain around complement or substitute? how ai increases the demand for human skills [pdf] is where risk accumulates, not at the surface.

## keep / ignore
- Signal: incentives now favor stability over novelty.
- Noise: demos and commentary overstate production readiness.
- Noise: early excitement won’t survive the next budget cycle.
- Signal: the rollout path is designed for institutional buyers.

## exposure map
- complement or substitute? how ai increases the demand for human skills [pdf] amplifies model brittleness faster than the value it returns.
- Governance drift turns tactical choices around complement or substitute? how ai increases the demand for human skills [pdf] into strategic liabilities.
- The smallest edge case in complement or substitute? how ai increases the demand for human skills [pdf] becomes the largest reputational risk.

## my take
My stance is pragmatic: assume the shift is real, yet delay lock in until the operational story settles.

## ending questions
If the incentives flipped, what would stay sticky?
