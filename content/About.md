# About

Project Obsidian is a public digital garden built from an Obsidian vault.
It prioritizes clarity, backlinks, and incremental refinement over polished essays.

## Principles
- Notes are living documents.
- Links matter more than hierarchy.
- Drafts stay in the sandbox until reviewed.

## Current status
- Quartz v4 scaffolding is in place.
- Content migration is in progress.
