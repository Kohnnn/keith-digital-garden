# AI Agents Development

A practical playbook for using AI agents as a research and build layer.

## why
- AI is a speed multiplier when prompts are tight and review is strict.
- Public tools are fast. Local stacks are controllable.

## public agents
**Pros**
- Low cost entry
- No local hardware burden

**Cons**
- Model limits on free tiers
- Less control over memory and workflows

## local RAG stack
- Ollama
- Open source models
- Vector DB (Postgres or Supabase)
- Docker

## workflow
- Input data -> vector DB -> LLM
- Webhook or FastAPI for local inference
