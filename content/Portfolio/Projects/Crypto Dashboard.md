# Crypto Dashboard

A set of dashboards I use for cycle timing and market structure.

## Bitcoin performance
- Log-scale price history with halving markers
- Year to date ROI by asset
- Post-halving ROI curves

## market cap view
- Looker Studio dashboard for market cap structure

## chart sandbox
- CRYPTOCAP:TOTAL3
- FRED:WALCL
- BLS:UNRATE and DOL:USIJC
- BTC dominance vs total (ex stablecoins)

## data source
- Bitcoin price CSV (Google Sheets)
