# Market Cycle Playbook

A compact framework for navigating crypto market cycles with signal hygiene.

## core logic
- Crypto moves in visible phases. Timing matters more than certainty.
- Macro liquidity and on-chain activity decide tempo.
- Risk comes first, returns are a side effect.

## cycle phases
- **Accumulation**: low volume, early price lift (2011, 2015, 2019, 2023)
- **Growth**: post-halving expansion (2012, 2016, 2020, 2024)
- **Bubble**: parabolic behavior (2013, 2017, 2021)
- **Crash**: reset and regulation shock (2014, 2018, 2024)

## signal stack
**Technical**
- Halving cadence
- BTC dominance drift
- On-chain flow metrics

**Macro**
- Liquidity and rate shifts
- Inflation and policy pivots
- Geopolitical stress

## execution cues
- Accumulation: DCA near realized price
- Growth: rotate into alt beta when BTC dominance peaks
- Bubble: rebalance before sentiment flips
- Crash: protect capital, keep a watchlist

## altcoin filter
- Utility, tokenomics, architecture
- Market cap behavior vs BTC
