Early-March was a re-test week for conviction after several weeks of narrative drift.

I kept cross-checking with [[weekly-market-report-2021-W08]] because the same liquidity-vs-conviction tension kept repeating.

## Overall Summary
This week stayed transitional. Conviction appeared in bursts, but the structure remained narrow and sensitive to macro framing.

- Narrative momentum remained stronger than structural confirmation.
- Participation stayed narrower than headlines implied.
- I favored confirmation over anticipation.

## Regime Call
Regime: transitional — inflation path uncertain; breadth still thin.

## Signals I'm Watching
- Main risk: macro narrative hardens faster than liquidity can absorb.
- Main opportunity: broader participation confirms directional follow-through.

## Positioning Snapshot
I stayed tactical, focused on reaction over prediction, and kept flexibility high.

## Commentary
The key for me was distinguishing conviction from noise. Many strong opinions were circulating, but only part of that translated into durable price behavior.

## Rates & Liquidity
Rates and liquidity were still the base layer. Even when not explicitly dominant in headlines, they framed how far risk could travel.

## Equities
Equity risk looked selective rather than broad. I focused on leadership durability and avoided assuming index stability meant broad health.

## Commodities & FX
Commodities and FX acted as secondary confirmation tools. Dollar direction and inflation framing still influenced conviction.

## Crypto Macro
Crypto narratives were loud this quarter, but I kept returning to structure and execution discipline.

## Positioning & Flow
Flow quality was mixed. I did not read this as a clean trend regime, so I kept position sizing conservative and adaptive.

## What Changed This Week
The first change was narrative pressure: stronger macro language around inflation and policy made the tape more reflexive.

## Risk Map
My risk map stayed simple: policy path, rate expectations, and participation quality.

## Analyst Notes
I treated this week as another reminder that consistency beats excitement in transitional regimes.

## Outlook Next Week
Next week I want to see whether narrative intensity converts into structural confirmation.

- Main risk: sentiment runs ahead of structure.
- Main opportunity: breadth broadens and confirms trend.

## questions / next
- What breaks if rate expectations reprice faster than flows?
- Is participation broadening or just rotating among a few leaders?
- Where did I overfit narrative instead of structure?

## Extra Notes
### Narrative Weighting
risk 30% / structure 25% / pattern 20% / trust 15% / value 10%.

### Data Quality
Data quality: mixed — narrative-heavy inputs with selective hard-data anchors.

### Counter-thesis
This view breaks if breadth improves decisively while macro pressure cools.
