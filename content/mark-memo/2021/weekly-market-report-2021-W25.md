My read is this week was less about valuation and more about operating assumptions. Once policy headlines hit mining and infrastructure, the market had to price execution risk instead of pure demand growth. I stayed cautious because this was a structural question, not a one-day chart question.

I am watching whether this week's move is true participation or just another tactical rotation. In this regime, those two look similar for a day and very different over a week.

The risk is not a single headline. The risk is sequence: policy tone, rate repricing, then flow quality. If that sequence lines up against risk assets, drawdowns become self-reinforcing.

What I want to see next week is simple: better breadth, calmer volatility, and cleaner follow-through after macro data. If I only get one of those three, I keep sizing smaller.

## Overall Summary
- The week stayed transitional with high narrative sensitivity.
- BTC briefly tested sub-$30k territory before bouncing.
- hashrate narrative became a primary risk topic.
- equity leadership stayed concentrated.

## Commentary
- My lens is still rates-plus-liquidity first, then leadership quality.
- I treated sharp moves as information, not automatic conviction.
- If structure and participation diverge, I trust structure.

## Rates & Liquidity
- I watched yields, dollar tone, and policy language as the macro ceiling for risk.
- Liquidity quality remained uneven; tactical flow dominated at key pivots.

## Equities
- Equity leadership remained selective, and breadth lagged headline strength.
- I favored setups with cleaner downside definition rather than crowded momentum.

## Commodities & FX
- USD direction still influenced how confidently I read risk-on sessions.
- Commodity context helped separate inflation fear from growth confidence.

## Crypto Macro
- Crypto remained the fastest thermometer for macro stress and liquidity confidence.
- I prioritized support behavior, participation quality, and reaction to policy headlines.

## Positioning & Flow
- Flow looked tactical and often reflexive around macro catalysts.
- I stayed process-first: smaller size, clearer invalidation, faster adaptation.

## Outlook Next Week
- Main risk: narrative intensity outruns structural confirmation again.
- Main opportunity: volatility cools while participation broadens.

## questions / next
- Short answer from last week: I stayed tactical because follow-through was inconsistent.
- Which signal has highest edge next week: rates, breadth, or volatility?
- What breaks first if macro pressure returns: weak leadership or crypto beta?
- Where am I mistaking relief for trend?

## Extra Notes
### Narrative Weighting
risk 30% / structure 25% / pattern 20% / trust 15% / value 10%.

### Data Quality
Data quality: mixed — official macro releases plus transcript context, with uneven week-to-week flow reliability.

### Counter-thesis
This view breaks if participation broadens materially while volatility compresses and policy tone stabilizes.

## Cross Review
