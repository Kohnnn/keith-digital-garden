My read is this week was a confidence test. On paper, conditions looked good enough for risk-on continuation, but participation quality stayed uneven. That mismatch matters. It tells me the rally can continue, but it remains vulnerable to any macro surprise.

I am watching whether this week's move is true participation or just another tactical rotation. In this regime, those two look similar for a day and very different over a week.

The risk is not a single headline. The risk is sequence: policy tone, rate repricing, then flow quality. If that sequence lines up against risk assets, drawdowns become self-reinforcing.

What I want to see next week is simple: better breadth, calmer volatility, and cleaner follow-through after macro data. If I only get one of those three, I keep sizing smaller.

## Overall Summary
- The week stayed transitional with high narrative sensitivity.
- Ongoing inflation debate kept yields sensitive.
- BTC stayed in a broad $33k to $36k band.
- US equities printed new highs with uneven breadth.

## Commentary
- My lens is still rates-plus-liquidity first, then leadership quality.
- I treated sharp moves as information, not automatic conviction.
- If structure and participation diverge, I trust structure.

## Rates & Liquidity
- I watched yields, dollar tone, and policy language as the macro ceiling for risk.
- Liquidity quality remained uneven; tactical flow dominated at key pivots.

## Equities
- Equity leadership remained selective, and breadth lagged headline strength.
- I favored setups with cleaner downside definition rather than crowded momentum.

## Commodities & FX
- USD direction still influenced how confidently I read risk-on sessions.
- Commodity context helped separate inflation fear from growth confidence.

## Crypto Macro
- Crypto remained the fastest thermometer for macro stress and liquidity confidence.
- I prioritized support behavior, participation quality, and reaction to policy headlines.

## Positioning & Flow
- Flow looked tactical and often reflexive around macro catalysts.
- I stayed process-first: smaller size, clearer invalidation, faster adaptation.

## Outlook Next Week
- Main risk: narrative intensity outruns structural confirmation again.
- Main opportunity: volatility cools while participation broadens.

## questions / next
- Short answer from last week: I stayed tactical because follow-through was inconsistent.
- Which signal has highest edge next week: rates, breadth, or volatility?
- What breaks first if macro pressure returns: weak leadership or crypto beta?
- Where am I mistaking relief for trend?

## Extra Notes
### Narrative Weighting
risk 30% / structure 25% / pattern 20% / trust 15% / value 10%.

### Data Quality
Data quality: mixed — official macro releases plus transcript context, with uneven week-to-week flow reliability.

### Counter-thesis
This view breaks if participation broadens materially while volatility compresses and policy tone stabilizes.

## Cross Review
