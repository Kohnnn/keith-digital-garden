My read is this week centered on recovery with asymmetric fragility. The surface-level move looked cleaner than the underlying participation, so I stayed selective instead of broad. I kept asking the same question: is this a structural bid or a tactical reaction?

I did not treat headline relief as confirmation. In this regime, confirmation requires sequence: stable macro tone, resilient breadth, then clean follow-through. Missing one of those steps usually means the move remains fragile.

The risk I kept on screen was simple: labor print improved relative to prior month, equity trend strengthened into earnings season, and crypto regained upside momentum. When those three signals diverge, I reduce conviction and protect optionality.

What I want to see next week is less emotional speed and more structural consistency. If I get calmer volatility plus broader participation, I can increase size. If not, I keep this as a tactical tape.

## Overall Summary
- The week stayed transitional with policy and inflation still framing risk appetite.
- labor print improved relative to prior month
- equity trend strengthened into earnings season
- crypto regained upside momentum

## Commentary
- I prioritized causality over narrative volume: what moved first, what moved second, what failed to confirm.
- I treated upside as conditional until participation widened beyond familiar leaders.
- The core lens remained rates + liquidity + breadth, in that order.

## Rates & Liquidity
- I tracked policy language, real yields, and dollar tone as the weekly ceiling for risk.
- Liquidity quality looked better in bursts, but consistency remained the missing piece.

## Equities
- Equity direction held up better than equity quality in several sessions.
- I favored names with cleaner balance-sheet and pricing-power support over pure narrative beta.

## Commodities & FX
- Commodity and FX behavior helped validate whether inflation fear or growth confidence dominated.
- Dollar tone still acted as a confidence filter for marginal risk-taking.

## Crypto Macro
- Crypto remained the fastest risk proxy for policy and liquidity sentiment.
- I prioritized structure and participation quality over aggressive directional forecasts.

## Positioning & Flow
- Flow stayed tactical around macro catalysts and often reversed quickly.
- I kept size adaptive and invalidation rules explicit to avoid regime overfitting.

## Outlook Next Week
- Main risk: macro narrative re-tightens before participation can broaden.
- Main opportunity: volatility compresses while leadership quality improves.

## questions / next
- Short answer from last week: I stayed tactical and avoided broad conviction without confirmation.
- Which signal has highest predictive value next week: rates, breadth, or volatility?
- What fails first if macro pressure returns: fragile leadership or crypto beta?
- Where am I mistaking tactical relief for structural trend?

## Extra Notes
### Narrative Weighting
risk 30% / structure 25% / pattern 20% / trust 15% / value 10%.

### Data Quality
Data quality: mixed — official macro releases plus transcript context; flow interpretation remains probabilistic.

### Counter-thesis
This view breaks if breadth broadens decisively while volatility compresses and policy communication remains stable.
