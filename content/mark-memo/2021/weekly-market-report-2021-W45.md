I read this week as labor resilience under inflation stress. I avoided broad conviction because the tape still showed strong headline moves with uneven internal confirmation. Instead of chasing direction, I stayed with process: identify the regime, map invalidation, and only then add risk.

The best trades this week were less about speed and more about sequence. I wanted the same chain every time: macro catalyst, rates reaction, breadth response, then crypto confirmation. Whenever one link failed, I treated upside as tactical and reduced position size.

My anchor set stayed constant: nfp rebound supported cyclical confidence, real yields and inflation expectations remained dominant, and btc advanced toward highs as macro and flow aligned briefly. If those signals aligned, I allowed more conviction; if they diverged, I protected capital first.

For next week, my bias is conditional. I need cleaner participation and calmer cross-asset correlations before I increase risk. If volatility remains event-driven, I will continue prioritizing flexibility over prediction.

## Overall Summary
- The week stayed transitional with inflation and policy still setting the ceiling for risk.
- NFP rebound supported cyclical confidence
- real yields and inflation expectations remained dominant
- BTC advanced toward highs as macro and flow aligned briefly

## Commentary
- I focused on cause-effect structure instead of narrative velocity.
- I sized positions around invalidation first, not conviction first.
- I treated index strength and breadth strength as separate signals.

## Rates & Liquidity
- Real yields, dollar tone, and policy language remained the primary filter for risk-taking.
- Liquidity still supported rallies, but reaction asymmetry increased around macro releases.

## Equities
- Index-level resilience masked frequent factor rotation and quality preference.
- I favored pricing-power and balance-sheet durability over pure narrative beta.

## Commodities & FX
- Commodity pressure and dollar behavior helped confirm whether inflation fear dominated.
- FX moves remained useful for validating or rejecting short-horizon equity narratives.

## Crypto Macro
- Crypto traded as a high-frequency policy and liquidity barometer.
- I avoided overfitting to single-session moves without broader participation support.

## Positioning & Flow
- Flow was tactical and often event-clustered around macro dates.
- I kept exposure modular so I could add or cut quickly without breaking process.

## News Tape
- Macro headlines dominated direction, but second-order effects came from rates and sector dispersion.
- Event shocks changed correlation structure faster than trend signals could adapt.

## Blog / Research Pulse
- Report-style research was more useful than hot takes for keeping regime labels stable.
- I used cross-checks between macro releases and crypto analytics before increasing conviction.

## Outlook Next Week
- Main risk: inflation and policy expectations tighten financial conditions faster than expected.
- Main opportunity: breadth improves while volatility compresses after event clusters clear.

## questions / next
- Did I separate structural trend from event-driven relief correctly?
- Which signal deserves highest weight next week: rates, breadth, or volatility?
- Where can liquidity mask weak participation for longer than expected?
- What invalidates this week's regime label first?

## Extra Notes
### Narrative Weighting
risk 30% / structure 25% / trust 20% / value 15% / change 10%.

### Data Quality
Data quality: mixed - official macro releases plus market news and research reports.

### Counter-thesis
This view breaks if participation broadens decisively while inflation sensitivity fades and policy communication stabilizes.

## Cross Review
- Linked from: [[weekly-market-report-2021-W46]] - Follow-up week re-tested this regime transition.
