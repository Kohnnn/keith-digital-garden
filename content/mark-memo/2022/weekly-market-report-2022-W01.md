My read is policy repricing before first hike. I treated this tape as regime work, not hero-trade territory, because the market kept switching from macro certainty to headline reflex within hours.

I kept my process simple: rate path first, liquidity second, breadth third, crypto confirmation last. When one leg of that chain broke, I reduced risk instead of forcing a narrative.

The anchors this week were clear: us payrolls added +199k while unemployment fell to 3.9%, 10y yield moved toward 1.75% as front-end pricing hardened, and btc slipped from the high-$40k zone toward low-$40k support. Those signals gave me a framework for sizing, not prediction.

What I want to see next week is cleaner participation and less event-driven correlation. If that improves, I can lean in; if not, I stay tactical and cash-aware.

## Overall Summary
- Macro stayed dominant, with inflation and policy expectations setting the risk ceiling.
- US payrolls added +199k while unemployment fell to 3.9%
- 10Y yield moved toward 1.75% as front-end pricing hardened
- BTC slipped from the high-$40k zone toward low-$40k support

## Commentary
- I prioritized causal sequencing over single-headline interpretation.
- I treated relief rallies as tactical until breadth and liquidity confirmed.
- I sized for uncertainty and kept invalidation explicit.

## Rates & Liquidity
- Front-end rates and Fed messaging remained the strongest macro transmitters.
- Liquidity conditions still allowed rebounds, but with lower tolerance for valuation stretch.

## Equities
- Index resilience often masked narrow leadership and factor churn.
- I favored cash-flow and pricing-power profiles over long-duration narratives.

## Commodities & FX
- Commodity and FX action kept validating inflation persistence risk.
- Dollar behavior remained a high-signal filter for global risk appetite.

## Crypto Macro
- Crypto traded as a high-beta expression of global liquidity and policy repricing.
- I watched leverage flushes and participation quality before trusting upside continuation.

## Positioning & Flow
- Positioning looked tactical and event-driven rather than trend-conviction heavy.
- I kept entries staggered and reduced size when correlation spikes returned.

## Outlook Next Week
- Main risk: inflation and policy repricing tighten financial conditions faster than expected.
- Main opportunity: volatility compresses while breadth broadens across risk assets.

## questions / next
- Short answer from last week: tactical discipline worked better than broad conviction.
- Which signal should lead my risk map next week: rates, breadth, or volatility?
- What would invalidate my current regime label quickly?
- Where am I underestimating second-order effects from policy and commodities?

## Extra Notes
### Narrative Weighting
risk 30% / structure 25% / scarcity 20% / trust 15% / value 10%.

### Data Quality
Data quality: mixed - official macro releases plus market news and research reports.

### Counter-thesis
This view breaks if inflation cools faster than expected while participation broadens and rates volatility fades.
