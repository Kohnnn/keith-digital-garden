My read is inflation apex test. I kept this week in a defensive-creative mode: defensive on size, creative on structure, because the tape rewarded process more than prediction.

I tried to avoid monolithic narratives. Instead I split the week into micro-regimes: catalyst impulse, rates translation, equity breadth response, then crypto follow-through. That sequence kept me from overreacting to single-session volatility.

## Overall Summary
- The week stayed policy-driven, with inflation and liquidity constraints setting the upper bound.
- US CPI reached 8.5% YoY
- Real yields and dollar strength challenged risk premia
- BTC lost momentum and reverted toward lower range levels

## Commentary
- I treated headline velocity as noise until rates and breadth confirmed direction.
- I focused on what changed in the reaction function, not what changed in the narrative.
- I kept conviction conditional and sized around explicit failure points.

## Rates & Liquidity
- Front-end repricing and balance-sheet expectations remained the dominant market drivers.
- Liquidity quality deteriorated in bursts, increasing the odds of failed follow-through.

## Equities
- Index moves frequently overstated underlying participation quality.
- I favored durable cash-flow and balance-sheet profiles over crowded long-duration themes.

## Commodities & FX
- Commodity behavior continued to shape inflation credibility and macro risk premiums.
- Dollar tone stayed a high-frequency filter for global risk appetite.

## Crypto Macro
- Crypto remained highly sensitive to global liquidity and rates volatility.
- I used participation and leverage behavior as confirmation before adding risk.

## Positioning & Flow
- Positioning looked tactical, with quick reversals around macro headlines.
- I kept entries modular and reduced gross exposure when correlation spikes returned.

## Outlook Next Week
- Main risk: policy and inflation repricing tighten conditions faster than growth can absorb.
- Main opportunity: volatility compresses while breadth and liquidity quality improve together.

## questions / next
- Short answer from last week: process discipline outperformed broad directional conviction.
- Which variable gets first priority next week: front-end rates, breadth, or commodity volatility?
- What would force me to switch from tactical to structural risk-taking?
- Where is correlation hiding fragility in my current read?

## Extra Notes
### Narrative Weighting
risk 30% / structure 25% / policy 20% / trust 15% / value 10%.

### Data Quality
Data quality: mixed - official releases, macro news tape, and report-style research.

### Counter-thesis
This view breaks if inflation cools faster than expected while breadth broadens and funding stress eases.

## Cross Review
