My read this week: Fed delivered another 75 bps hike while growth fears and relief trading coexisted. I stayed in scenario mode because the tape kept rewarding flexible decision boundaries over static conviction.

I mapped each day by transition rather than headline - what changed in policy pressure, what changed in breadth, and what changed in funding behavior. That map let me avoid emotional overtrading during high-correlation moves.

> "I care less about perfect calls and more about preserving edge through regime shifts."

## Overall Summary
- The tape remained macro-sensitive, with policy and inflation setting the operating range.
- Fomc hiked 75 bps again and reinforced inflation control priority
- Equities bounced as terminal-rate speculation shifted
- Btc recovered into risk-on windows but lacked full confirmation

## Commentary
- I prioritized causality over commentary and avoided one-note narratives.
- I upgraded conviction only when rates direction and breadth quality aligned.
- I treated high-correlation sessions as risk-management tests, not opportunity spikes.

## Rates & Liquidity
- Front-end rate pricing and QT expectations remained the dominant valuation filter.
- Liquidity behaved in clusters, making follow-through quality more important than headline magnitude.

## Equities
- Index performance continued to mask uneven participation beneath the surface.
- I favored balance-sheet resilience and earnings durability over thematic beta.

## Commodities & FX
- Commodity and dollar behavior remained core inputs for inflation and risk-premium calibration.
- FX swings kept acting as a fast proxy for global stress transfer.

## Crypto Macro
- Crypto stayed tied to global liquidity and macro risk appetite, with short reflex windows.
- I used participation quality and leverage behavior before trusting upside continuation.

## Positioning & Flow
- Flow looked tactical and event-driven, with frequent regime flips around macro catalysts.
- I kept exposure modular to scale with signal quality rather than headline urgency.

## Outlook Next Week
- Main risk: policy path and inflation persistence trigger another correlation shock.
- Main opportunity: volatility compresses while breadth and liquidity improve simultaneously.

## questions / next
- Short answer from last week: disciplined sizing beat narrative chasing.
- Which variable deserves top weight next week: front-end rates, breadth, or commodity trend?
- What would convert this setup from tactical to structural risk-on?
- Where am I overfitting short-term relief into medium-term thesis?

## Extra Notes
### Narrative Weighting
risk 30% / structure 25% / policy 20% / trust 15% / value 10%.

### Data Quality
Data quality: mixed - official releases, market news tape, and report-style research.

### Counter-thesis
This view breaks if inflation decelerates quickly while breadth broadens and funding stress fades.

## Cross Review
