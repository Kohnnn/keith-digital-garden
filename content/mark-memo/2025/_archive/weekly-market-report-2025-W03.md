# Weekly Market Report 2025-W03

This week was about rotation and data whipsaws. The tape felt like it was constantly updating its story as new numbers came in. The move was strong, but the foundation felt shaky because the underlying inputs kept shifting: CPI, PPI, retail sales, and policy talk all pulled the narrative in different directions.

I saw a clear rotation out of big tech and into value, healthcare, energy, and materials. That rotation mattered more to me than the index level. The S&P pushing back above 6000 is a headline, but the real story is what money moved into and why. It felt like a “flight to durability” more than a “risk-on run.”

The macro backdrop was heavy. A $700B budget deficit headline and a $1T China trade surplus framed the week’s stress points. The market can digest one macro worry at a time; this week it had to digest several. Add in the Fed’s hint at four cuts for 2025 and the USD’s fragile tone, and you get a tape that rallies but doesn’t fully convince.

## Overall Summary
This was a strong tape with weak conviction. The market liked cooler CPI and the idea of a pivot, but the data cadence kept forcing the narrative to reset. That’s why the rally felt fragile even when price was strong.

The fiscal and trade numbers added a structural layer to the week. A $700B deficit headline and $1T trade surplus are not day-trader inputs; they’re regime inputs. That’s why I treated the move as a tactical rally rather than a new trend.

- Rotation to value stayed the story as big tech cooled.
- The week was framed by a $700B deficit narrative and a $1T China trade surplus.
- Core CPI cooled, but the data cadence kept conviction low.
- The S&P pushed above 6000 without broad participation.

## Regime Call
Regime: risk-off — policy risk elevated; inflation path uncertain.

## Signals I'm Watching
- Main risk: a rate shock off data.
- Main opportunity: a clean USD trend that supports risk.

## Positioning Snapshot
I stayed defensive, kept size smaller, and prioritized capital preservation.

## Commentary
I kept cross-checking with [[weekly-market-report-2025-W02]] because the rate sensitivity remained the dominant variable. The difference was that this week rate sensitivity showed up inside the equity tape itself through sector rotation, not just in bond pricing.

The market also felt conflicted: on one hand, CPI cooled to 2.9% headline and 3.2% core, which should ease pressure; on the other hand, the fiscal signal and the trade surplus screamed structural imbalance. That mismatch kept me from leaning into the rally.

This is the kind of week where I value process over conviction. The data are too loud to assume a smooth trend. I can acknowledge the rally while still treating it as a move that needs confirmation.

- Risk felt rate-driven, not earnings-driven.
- The tape stayed fragile because policy expectations kept shifting.
- I kept the bias tactical until breadth improves.

## Rates & Liquidity
CPI at 2.9% headline and 3.2% core should have calmed the rate narrative, but it didn’t completely. The market still priced multiple cuts and kept the “four cuts in 2025” idea alive, which made yields reactive rather than stable.

The rate trade also got tangled with USD weakness. A softer dollar can support risk, but if it’s paired with structural fiscal stress, it becomes a different signal. That’s why I treated the USD move as a cautious positive, not a full green light.

- CPI ran 2.9% headline and 3.2% core, keeping rate expectations in flux.
- The market still priced multiple cuts, but conviction stayed low.

## Equities
The rotation was the story. Big tech cooled and value and defensives caught the flow. I read that as a shift in risk appetite rather than a full risk-on posture. In a rate-sensitive tape, rotation is often the first signal before a trend emerges.

The S&P back above 6000 is meaningful, but not sufficient. I want to see participation widen and I want to see the index hold without leaning on one or two stocks. This week didn’t deliver that.

- The rally felt headline-supported, not breadth-supported.
- Leadership stayed narrow; dispersion remained the signal.

## Commodities & FX
USD swings set the macro mood again. A weaker dollar typically supports risk, but in a fiscal-stress week, it can also act as a warning. I watched commodity moves as confirmation rather than catalysts.

Gold strength read like a hedge. It made sense in a week where fiscal headlines were loud and policy guidance was mixed. I’m not treating it as a trend, but I respect the signal.

- USD swings set the macro mood.
- Gold strength read like a hedge, not a breakout.

## Crypto Macro
BTC approached $100k after the CPI report, which is a useful temperature check. It showed the market was willing to take risk when the data aligned. But the same week also saw a range sweep lower, which tells me positioning was not stable.

I kept leaning on liquidity signals. BTC dominance and the bull market support band remain my guide. The higher BTC goes, the more I need to see dominance stabilize before I risk broader exposure.

- BTC reacted to the data cadence more than any narrative.
- Liquidity signals still led the short-term trend.

## Positioning & Flow
Positioning stayed tactical. I saw fast reallocations rather than sticky conviction. That aligns with a market that is still unsure about the rate path.

I also noticed how quickly the tape could flip on data. That makes me cautious about extrapolating the rally. I want to see stable breadth and a calmer rate narrative before I treat this as a durable move.

- Positioning stayed cautious; flows felt tactical.
- If yields move quickly, positioning will flip fast.

## Outlook Next Week
The next week is about whether the data cadence calms down. If we get a clearer inflation signal and stable yields, the market can breathe and leadership can broaden.

Until then, I keep my posture tactical. I’ll respect the move, but I won’t assume it’s a trend unless breadth confirms.

- Main risk: a rate shock off data.
- Main opportunity: a clean USD trend that supports risk.

policy 38% / inflation 31% / liquidity 31%.
### Data Quality
Data quality: moderate — hard data is present, but the narrative is still noisy.
### Counter-thesis
This view breaks if breadth improves and policy risk fades enough to sustain risk-on flows.
