# Weekly Market Report 2025-W07

This week was about inflation noise, policy risk, and the market’s stubborn ability to green despite ugly data. I saw a tape that refused to break even when the numbers looked unfriendly. That makes me cautious: it can be resilience, or it can be complacency.

The PPI move was the first red flag. The composite PPI print moved from roughly 0.2 to 0.5, more than double the prior reading. CPI was also a headline, with inflation cited around 3.0%. Those are not small shifts. They change the rate story, and they make it harder to assume a smooth cut path.

At the same time, the policy backdrop stayed loud. Tariff language was aggressive, and the market had to digest a large AI deal headline (a $97B OpenAI bid), plus capex numbers in the $250B range for large tech and 129B euros in European AI investment guidance. The data and the narrative were both large, and the tape was forced to hold both in its head.

## Overall Summary
This week was a test of the market’s tolerance for higher inflation. The price action stayed green in parts of the week, but I did not read that as a clean risk-on. The risk premium felt higher, not lower.

The inflation narrative widened: PPI jumped, CPI was framed near 3.0%, and retail sales were described as weak with a notable downward revision (0.4 to 0.7 percentage points). That mix is not friendly for a cutting cycle.

- PPI moved from ~0.2 to ~0.5, more than double the prior read.
- CPI was framed around 3.0% and kept rate expectations tense.
- Retail sales revisions (0.4 to 0.7 points) reinforced softness.
- Policy noise remained high with tariff rhetoric and large AI funding headlines.

## Regime Call
Regime: risk-on — policy risk elevated; inflation path uncertain.

## Signals I'm Watching
- Main risk: inflation forces the rate path higher.
- Main opportunity: softer data reopens the cut narrative.

## Positioning Snapshot
I stayed tactical, focused on reaction over prediction, and kept flexibility high.

## Commentary
I kept cross-checking with [[weekly-market-report-2025-W06]] because the policy-labor tension carried into this week, but the inflation signal got louder. The market’s refusal to break despite hot inflation is either a sign of resilience or a sign of risk compression. I leaned toward caution.

The AI and capex headlines were huge. A $97B bid and $250B annual capex plans are not just tech stories; they are liquidity stories. The question for me is whether that capex absorbs liquidity or creates it. In the short term, it looks like absorption, which should tighten the tape.

I stayed tactical. I respect the price action, but I don’t trust it without clearer inflation direction.

- I treated green tape as tactical rather than confirmation.
- Policy and inflation headlines raised the risk premium.
- I need stable inflation data before I add risk.

## Rates & Liquidity
Rates were the risk anchor this week. A PPI jump to ~0.5 and CPI near 3.0% are enough to keep the Fed in wait mode. The market also had to absorb a $58B auction headline, which reinforced the supply pressure.

The mix of inflation and auction supply keeps the liquidity base thin. If inflation stays sticky, the rate path moves higher. That caps risk.

- PPI moved from ~0.2 to ~0.5, a clear upward surprise.
- CPI near 3.0% kept the cut narrative in check.
- The $58B auction headline reinforced supply pressure.

## Equities
Equities held up, but I saw dispersion. The market rallied on selective narratives rather than broad participation. The OpenAI and AI capex headlines supported specific names, but the rest of the tape felt reactive.

Retail sales weakness was a quiet but important signal. A downward revision (0.4 to 0.7 points) and a note about the sharpest decline since March 2023 raised concerns about consumer momentum. That matters when inflation is still sticky.

- The AI narrative held parts of the tape together.
- Retail sales revisions flagged consumer fragility.

## Commodities & FX
Gold running toward $3k was a loud macro signal. In a week with inflation noise and policy risk, that makes sense. I read it as a hedge bid rather than a speculative chase.

The dollar stayed sensitive to the policy tape. In this regime, FX is a risk signal more than a growth signal.

- Gold near $3k read like a hedge against sticky inflation.
- FX stayed sensitive to tariff headlines.

## Crypto Macro
The crypto side felt like a cautionary mirror. The memecoin commentary underscored misallocation risk, while BTC market cycle framing kept me in a macro-first stance. I didn’t see a clean alt rotation.

I treated crypto flows as risk-sensitive rather than independent. If inflation stays hot and the rate path stays high, crypto remains reactive.

- Crypto flow stayed tactical, not conviction.
- Cycle framing kept me focused on liquidity, not hype.

## Positioning & Flow
Flows felt short-term again. The tape was driven by headlines and data surprises, not by steady accumulation. That is not a backdrop where I want to chase.

The market can stay green for longer than I expect, but I don’t want to be late when it turns. That’s why I kept risk smaller.

- Positioning remained tactical.
- I want evidence of stable inflation before I commit.

## Outlook Next Week
Next week is about whether inflation data cools or heats further. If inflation surprises lower, the market can extend. If not, the risk premium climbs.

I will keep watching the balance between policy noise and liquidity. The tape has been resilient, but I do not trust resilience without confirmation.

- Main risk: inflation forces the rate path higher.
- Main opportunity: softer data reopens the cut narrative.

policy 30% / inflation 25% / liquidity 25% / growth 20%.
### Data Quality
Data quality: mixed — revisions matter, so I treat the signal with caution.
### Counter-thesis
This view breaks if rates reprice higher or breadth narrows again.
