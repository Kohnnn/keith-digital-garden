# Weekly Market Report 2025-W10

This week stayed quiet on the macro headline front, which pushed me even deeper into cycle framing. When the macro calendar is thin, I look to the cycle indicators for structure and to positioning for risk. The crypto cycle discussions dominated the week, and that became my proxy for broader risk appetite.

The $100k level remained the main psychological reference point. I did not treat it as a magnet so much as a boundary: above it, sentiment gets confident; below it, the market quickly becomes defensive. That is why I treated the week as a positioning check rather than a trend call.

ETH and SOL were still the side narrative. The “butterfly effect” framing suggests sensitivity to small changes in trend, which is exactly the kind of environment where I avoid heavy leverage. I stayed deliberate.

## Overall Summary
This was another low-catalyst week with the macro story replaced by cycle framing. The absence of big data meant sentiment and positioning mattered more than headlines.

The dominant signal was still BTC cycle structure. The market did not show a clean directional break; it showed a setup for one.

- Macro headlines were muted.
- Cycle framing dominated the risk narrative.
- The $100k BTC level stayed the key psychological boundary.

## Regime Call
Regime: risk-off — policy risk elevated; inflation path uncertain.

## Quant Anchors
- 250303M — referenced this week.
- $100 — referenced this week.

## Signals I'm Watching
- Main risk: a sudden macro shock in a thin tape.
- Main opportunity: a clear catalyst breaks the range.

## Positioning Snapshot
I stayed defensive, kept size smaller, and prioritized capital preservation.

## Commentary
I kept cross-checking with [[weekly-market-report-2025-W09]] because the “quiet calendar” theme persisted. The difference this week was a stronger focus on cycle structure: are we in a right-translated phase or a left-translated phase? That framing matters because it shapes how I allocate risk.

When I don’t have a macro catalyst, I rely on structure and guardrails. The $100k level is a guardrail, not a prediction. I keep that distinction clear to avoid chasing noise.

- I leaned on structure over headlines.
- I treated the $100k level as a boundary, not a forecast.

## Rates & Liquidity
Rates were not the driver this week. That kept the tape quiet but also fragile. In a quiet rate week, liquidity becomes more about positioning than about fundamentals.

I stayed neutral. If rates re-enter the story, they can move the tape fast.

- Rates stayed quiet, leaving positioning in control.
- Liquidity felt stable but thin.

## Equities
The equity tape remained subdued. Without a major macro catalyst, equities were left to trade idiosyncratic narratives. I did not see a broad-based theme.

That means the risk is asymmetric: a new headline can reprice the tape quickly, but without a headline, the tape can drift.

- Equity narratives remained muted.
- I treated the tape as fragile, not stable.

## Commodities & FX
Commodities and FX were not leading. That is consistent with the low-catalyst environment. I treated them as secondary signals.

- Commodities and FX stayed quiet.
- I watched for any policy headline to change that.

## Crypto Macro
Crypto cycle framing dominated. The question of right- vs left-translated cycles matters because it tells me whether the market still has runway. I did not have enough confirmation to make a strong call, so I stayed cautious.

The $100k threshold kept acting as a sentiment anchor. I used it as a risk marker rather than a target.

- Cycle framing was the loudest signal.
- The $100k threshold remained the psychological anchor.

## Positioning & Flow
Flows were tactical. I did not see strong accumulation or distribution. That is typical in low-catalyst weeks.

I stayed flexible and kept my risk small. If the next catalyst appears, I want to respond quickly.

- Positioning stayed tactical.
- I prioritized flexibility over conviction.

## Outlook Next Week
Next week is about waiting for the next impulse. If macro data returns, we can get a clearer trend. If not, I expect more choppy, tactical movement.

I will keep using cycle structure and BTC thresholds as the main risk map until a broader macro narrative returns.

- Main risk: a sudden macro shock in a thin tape.
- Main opportunity: a clear catalyst breaks the range.

policy 30% / inflation 25% / liquidity 25% / growth 20%.
### Data Quality
Data quality: mixed — sentiment and positioning lead, hard data still mixed.
### Counter-thesis
This view breaks if breadth improves and policy risk fades enough to sustain risk-on flows.
