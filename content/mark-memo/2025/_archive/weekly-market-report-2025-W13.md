# Weekly Market Report 2025-W13

This week felt like a crypto-driven sentiment week. The macro calendar was not dominant, but the crypto risk metrics were loud. That put me in a defensive posture because those metrics tend to lead risk sentiment when the macro tape is quiet.

I kept cross-checking with [[weekly-market-report-2025-W12]] because the policy story had not fully resolved. The difference this week was the intensity of risk signals: fear/greed readings, social risk framing, and the looming death cross narrative all pointed to caution.

I treated the week as a risk management week rather than a return-seeking week. If a death cross narrative starts to take hold, you can get reflexive selling even without a macro catalyst.

## Overall Summary
The dominant signal was crypto risk metrics. The market felt fragile, even though there wasn’t a heavy macro headline list. That fragility matters because the next macro catalyst can hit a thin tape.

BTC approached the bull market support band, and the death cross talk raised the psychological risk. That kept me defensive.

I also saw a stronger emphasis on dominance and fear/greed framing, which tells me liquidity is still concentrating rather than broadening. When the market starts debating whether a death cross is “real,” that’s often a sign of fragile participation.

- Fear/greed framing and social risk metrics signaled caution.
- BTC approached the support band; death cross talk increased sensitivity.
- The tape felt fragile even without major macro headlines.

## Regime Call
Regime: risk-off — policy risk elevated; breadth still thin.

## Quant Anchors
- 250324M — referenced this week.
- 2.2% — referenced this week.

## Signals I'm Watching
- Main risk: sentiment worsens into a thin tape.
- Main opportunity: risk metrics stabilize and allow a reset.

## Positioning Snapshot
I stayed defensive, kept size smaller, and prioritized capital preservation.

## Commentary
I treated this week as a reminder that sentiment can reprice faster than fundamentals. When you see fear/greed and social risk warnings, the odds of reflexive moves increase.

I stayed cautious, even though part of me wanted to fade the fear. In a market with fragile liquidity, sentiment signals deserve respect.

This is also where I re-check my exposure assumptions. If my thesis depends on liquidity broadening, but the signals say liquidity is narrowing, I scale down and wait.

- I prioritized risk management over return-seeking.
- Sentiment signals carried more weight than usual.

## Rates & Liquidity
Rates were not a dominant driver this week. That made liquidity the main story. In quiet rate weeks, positioning and sentiment often take the driver’s seat.

That is why I keep a close eye on where liquidity is concentrating. If dominance rises and breadth fades, the market becomes more fragile to any single headline.

- Rates were quiet, but liquidity felt thin.
- Positioning became the dominant signal.

## Equities
Equities were quieter than crypto. The market felt like it was waiting for confirmation. I did not see broad participation.

- Equity narratives were muted.
- I stayed cautious because breadth was limited.

## Commodities & FX
Commodities and FX did not lead this week. That kept my focus on sentiment and liquidity.

- Commodity signals stayed secondary.
- FX did not provide a clear macro message.

## Crypto Macro
Crypto was the main narrative. The combination of fear/greed, social risk, death cross chatter, and dominance tracking is a clear caution setup. I treated it as a warning that the market could be more fragile than it looks.

I also watched for a “support-band reclaim” signal, because that is usually the first clue that risk appetite is returning. I did not see it this week, which kept me defensive.

- Fear/greed and social risk framing stayed elevated.
- Death cross narrative increased caution.
- BTC dominance remained a key risk budget signal.

## Positioning & Flow
Flows were tactical. I did not see accumulation. That reinforced my defensive posture.

When flows are tactical, I focus on capital preservation. It is easy to get chopped in sentiment-driven weeks. I would rather wait for a clearer signal than force one.

- Flows stayed tactical.
- I kept risk small until sentiment stabilizes.

## Outlook Next Week
Next week is about whether these risk signals fade or intensify. If fear/greed moderates, the tape can stabilize. If it intensifies, I expect defensive positioning to grow.

- Main risk: sentiment worsens into a thin tape.
- Main opportunity: risk metrics stabilize and allow a reset.

policy 55% / liquidity 45%.
### Data Quality
Data quality: mixed — sentiment and positioning lead, hard data still mixed.
### Counter-thesis
This view breaks if breadth improves and policy risk fades enough to sustain risk-on flows.
