# Weekly Market Report 2025-W24

This week was about inflation drifting higher and crypto breadth staying weak. Inflation rising to 2.4% is not a shock, but it is a reminder that the disinflation path is not clean. At the same time, alt‑risk metrics at 0.32 reinforced the idea that liquidity remains concentrated.

I kept cross‑checking with [[weekly-market-report-2025-W23]] because the labor story remained stable, but inflation re‑inserted itself as a risk input. That shift tends to tighten the tape, especially when breadth is already thin.

The equity narrative was muted. Without a strong catalyst, the market tends to lean on macro signals, and inflation was the loudest of those this week.

## Overall Summary
This was a cautious inflation week. CPI ticked up to 2.4%, and alt‑risk metrics stayed low (0.32), suggesting liquidity remained narrow. I treated the week as a warning against assuming easy disinflation.

The macro message was simple: inflation is not gone, and liquidity is not broad. That keeps my posture cautious.

- Inflation rose to 2.4% and re‑tightened the narrative.
- Alt‑risk metrics at 0.32 signaled narrow participation.
- The tape stayed cautious and lacked a clear catalyst.

## Regime Call
Regime: transitional — inflation path uncertain; breadth still thin.

## Quant Anchors
- 2.4% — inflation ticked higher.
- 0.32 — alt‑risk metric stayed weak.
- 2025 — cycle context for inflation drift.
- 24 — week marker for the regime check.

## Signals I'm Watching
- Main risk: inflation re‑accelerates and tightens liquidity.
- Main opportunity: breadth improves if inflation stabilizes.

## Positioning Snapshot
I stayed defensive, kept size smaller, and prioritized capital preservation.

## Commentary
The inflation uptick was not dramatic, but it was enough to keep me cautious. When inflation is already a key risk, even a small move can shift sentiment.

The alt‑risk metric at 0.32 is another warning. It tells me the market is not broadening, and that means any macro surprise can hit harder than expected.

- I treated inflation as the primary risk input.
- I stayed cautious because liquidity is still narrow.

## Rates & Liquidity
Rates were steady, but inflation rising to 2.4% keeps the rate path uncertain. That uncertainty tightens liquidity even when yields are calm.

- Inflation uncertainty kept liquidity fragile.
- I stayed cautious despite stable rates.

## Equities
Equities lacked a strong catalyst. The tape felt more like a macro‑driven drift than a trend. That keeps me neutral.

- Equity narrative was muted.
- I did not see breadth improvement.

## Commodities & FX
Commodities and FX were not leading. Inflation was the headline, and it set the tone without a clear cross‑asset confirmation.

- Commodities and FX stayed secondary.
- Inflation remained the main macro input.

## Crypto Macro
Alt‑risk at 0.32 is a clear signal that participation is thin. BTC support‑band signals still mattered, but I did not see a broad risk‑on posture.

- Alt‑risk stayed weak.
- Dominance remained a key filter.

## Positioning & Flow
Flows were defensive. I did not see evidence of accumulation or broad risk‑taking.

- Positioning stayed cautious.
- I kept risk small until breadth improves.

## What Changed This Week
The first change was the policy temperature. Even if the headlines cooled or heated, the market reacted as if policy remained the main risk input. That tells me the policy premium is still embedded in prices.

The second change was in concentration. Dominance metrics stayed loud, which means liquidity continued to cluster in a few areas. That keeps the tape fragile even when prices drift higher.

The third change was the labor narrative. A steady unemployment rate gives the market time, but it doesn’t guarantee participation. I stayed cautious until I see both stable data and broader participation.

## Risk Map
My risk map put policy at the top. When tariffs or legal headlines move, they reprice risk faster than data. That’s why I treated policy as the primary trigger this week.

The second layer is concentration. If dominance stays high, I assume the bid is narrow and fragile. Breadth is the confirmation I need to loosen the posture.

The final layer is inflation sensitivity. If inflation drifts higher, the risk premium expands quickly. That’s why I keep my exposure light until the data stabilizes.

## Analyst Notes
Policy risk was still a loud variable, and I treated that as a cap on conviction. When policy headlines are moving faster than fundamentals, price action becomes more reflexive and less durable. That is why I stayed selective.

The second check for me was concentration. Dominance signals told me liquidity was still narrow, which makes rallies more fragile. Until dominance cools, I treat upside as tactical.

Inflation remains the key fork in the road. If disinflation persists, the market can build a base. If inflation re‑accelerates, the risk premium will rise quickly. That’s the tension I keep front‑of‑mind.

The labor data keeps the story balanced. A stable unemployment rate buys time, but it does not guarantee a broad bid. That’s why I keep my time horizon short and react to confirmation rather than prediction.

Next week I want to see whether the signals align: breadth improving, policy risk fading, and liquidity broadening. If I see two of those three, I can lean in. If not, I stay patient.

## Outlook Next Week
Next week is about whether inflation stabilizes and whether breadth improves. If inflation cools and alt‑risk rises, the tape can stabilize. If not, the cautious regime stays intact.

I will also watch whether the inflation narrative bleeds into rate expectations. If yields stay calm despite higher inflation prints, that is a sign the market is willing to look through the noise. If yields jump, the fragile tape will likely tighten again.

- Main risk: inflation drifts higher again.
- Main opportunity: breadth improves if inflation stabilizes.

policy 30% / inflation 25% / liquidity 25% / growth 20%.
### Data Quality
Data quality: moderate — hard data is present, but the narrative is still noisy.
### Counter-thesis
This view breaks if either policy risk spikes or breadth improves materially.
