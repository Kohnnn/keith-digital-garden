# Weekly Market Report 2025-W06

This week felt like a policy-and-labor reset layered on top of thin liquidity. I saw the tape swing on tariff headlines, labor revisions, and a rotation back into big tech, but the conviction felt conditional. The price action told me that the market was willing to rally, but only if the policy backdrop did not worsen and the labor data did not surprise the wrong way.

The China response mattered. The 10% to 15% retaliation tariffs were not aggressive, yet they were enough to keep a risk premium in place. The market reaction felt like a slow exhale rather than a new risk-on phase. In a tape that is still concentrated, even a mild policy shock can create outsized price action.

The labor data added another layer. Revisions showed a 600,000 job loss vs the prior report, unemployment held at 4.0%, and the private sector print showed 183,000 jobs versus a 148,000 expectation, with December revised from 122,000 to 176,000. That mix kept me cautious: the revisions were a negative shock, but the current momentum still looked resilient. I read it as a mixed labor signal, not a clean pivot.

## Overall Summary
This week felt reactive rather than constructive. Policy headlines created volatility, while the labor data forced a reevaluation of the 2025 cut path. I did not see a broad bid; I saw a narrow bid that depended on stability in rates and policy.

The most important takeaway for me is the fragility of the liquidity base. A 10% to 15% tariff move was enough to keep the risk premium elevated. A 600,000 job revision was enough to force a re-think on the labor narrative. That is not a market that is ready for aggressive risk-on.

- China retaliated with 10% to 15% tariffs, keeping policy risk alive.
- Labor revisions showed a 600,000 job loss vs the prior report.
- Unemployment held at 4.0% while private payrolls printed 183,000 vs 148,000 expected.
- Leadership remained narrow; the bid felt conditional.

## Regime Call
Regime: risk-off — policy risk elevated; inflation path uncertain.

## Signals I'm Watching
- Main risk: policy headlines re-ignite volatility.
- Main opportunity: stable labor data supports a broader bid.

## Positioning Snapshot
I stayed defensive, kept size smaller, and prioritized capital preservation.

## Commentary
I kept cross-checking with [[weekly-market-report-2025-W05]] because the policy noise from last week carried into this week. The difference is that the policy story shifted from headline shock to “manageable retaliation.” That shift helped the tape stabilize, but it did not change the underlying fragility.

I also focused on the combination of a large revision and steady current prints. It’s easy to overreact to the revision, but it’s also dangerous to ignore it. A 600,000 revision is not a rounding error. I treated it as a risk signal, even if the current momentum still looks fine.

The market’s reaction told me one thing: participants are still looking for an excuse to extend, but they are not willing to commit without confirmation. I stayed tactical in that environment.

- I stayed cautious because the labor revision was large enough to change the story.
- The tariff response was mild, but it still kept the risk premium elevated.
- I’m treating rallies as tactical until breadth improves.

## Rates & Liquidity
Rates were the ceiling again. The labor revision is a reminder that the market does not have a clean labor story to price. When the labor narrative is unstable, rate expectations are unstable, and that makes liquidity fragile.

The ADP-style numbers (183,000 vs 148,000 expected, with December revised from 122,000 to 176,000) suggest current momentum is not collapsing. That helps keep yields elevated, which in turn keeps risk capped. It is not a bearish signal by itself, but it is a ceiling.

- Labor prints were mixed: 183,000 vs 148,000 expected, with December revised up to 176,000.
- The 600,000 downward revision keeps rate expectations sensitive.

## Equities
Equities moved in a narrow lane. Big tech caught a bid, but the market still felt concentrated. Amazon was down about 6% on its report, while the rest of the megacap basket held. That is not broad strength; it is selective strength.

I also noted the policy headlines around public sector resignations (around 60,000) and talk of $1T in foreign investment commitments. Those are big numbers, but they were not enough to broaden the tape. I treated them as narrative inputs, not confirmation.

- Amazon slipped about 6%, reinforcing the dispersion signal.
- The equity bid still leaned on a narrow group of leaders.

## Commodities & FX
Gold was a headline signal this week. The 163-ton inflow into the US is not trivial. I read it as a risk-hedge flow more than a directional bet. In a week with policy volatility, that makes sense.

The FX market stayed sensitive to tariffs. A mild retaliation can still keep the dollar supported, which in turn caps risk appetite. I kept a close eye on USD strength as a proxy for global risk.

- 163 tons of gold flowed back into the US, a meaningful hedge signal.
- USD sensitivity to tariffs kept the macro mood tight.

## Crypto Macro
BTC dominance hit 64% again, which kept me in a BTC-first posture. The lack of alt season is not a surprise in this liquidity regime. Until dominance softens, I don’t want to overreach.

ETH was the focal point for me this week, but I still treated it as a secondary signal. The broader liquidity structure still points to BTC leading the risk budget.

- BTC dominance near 64% kept the market in a BTC-led posture.
- Alt season still has not arrived; I stayed defensive on rotation bets.

## Positioning & Flow
Flows felt tactical. The market rallied when policy looked less severe, then hesitated when labor revisions hit. That is not durable positioning; it is reactive positioning.

I kept size smaller and focused on clarity. I want the policy story to stabilize and the labor story to stop shifting before I assume any trend.

- Positioning was reactive, not committed.
- I want stable policy + labor inputs before leaning into risk.

## Outlook Next Week
Next week is about whether the labor narrative stabilizes and whether tariffs remain contained. If the policy backdrop stays manageable and rates stay calm, the tape can extend. If not, the market will remain fragile.

I’m still watching for breadth. I want to see the bid expand beyond a handful of leaders. Without that, I treat any strength as tactical.

- Main risk: policy headlines re-ignite volatility.
- Main opportunity: stable labor data supports a broader bid.

policy 30% / inflation 25% / liquidity 25% / growth 20%.
### Data Quality
Data quality: mixed — revisions matter, so I treat the signal with caution.
### Counter-thesis
This view breaks if breadth improves and policy risk fades enough to sustain risk-on flows.
