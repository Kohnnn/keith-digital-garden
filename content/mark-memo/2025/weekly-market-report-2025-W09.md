# Weekly Market Report 2025-W09

This week felt quiet on the equity headline front, which pushed me to rely more on crypto and flow signals. The absence of strong market news is itself a signal: when there is no big catalyst, fragile trends are easier to reverse. I treated the week as a “wait for impulse” phase.

The clearest narrative came from crypto: BTC dominance continued to push higher, with the “dominance train to 66%” framing still in play. ETH looked like it was trying to find a home base, and SOL/BTC was described as an emotional trade. That is a reminder to me that liquidity and sentiment still control the rhythm.

Because the macro headline calendar was light, I focused on positioning. Flow felt tactical rather than conviction. That is not a setup for aggressive risk-on. It is a setup for patience.

## Overall Summary
This was a low-catalyst week with a high dependence on crypto macro signals. Equity stories were not dominant, which left the market without a clean narrative. I treated that as a reason to stay cautious.

The key takeaway is that BTC dominance kept rising while ETH struggled to reclaim momentum. That means risk appetite remained concentrated, not broad.

- Flow felt tactical, not conviction.
- BTC dominance continued to press toward the mid-60s.
- ETH and SOL/BTC signals read as fragile.

## Regime Call
Regime: risk-off — policy risk elevated; inflation path uncertain.

## Quant Anchors
- 250224M — referenced this week.
- 66% — referenced this week.

## Signals I'm Watching
- Main risk: a sudden macro shock in a thin tape.
- Main opportunity: a clean catalyst that breaks the range.

## Positioning Snapshot
I stayed defensive, kept size smaller, and prioritized capital preservation.

## Commentary
I kept cross-checking with [[weekly-market-report-2025-W08]] because the macro narrative did not change much. The difference this week was the quiet calendar. Without a big catalyst, the market relies on internal positioning, and that tends to be more fragile.

I also noticed how quickly sentiment swings on crypto narratives when the macro calendar is light. That is a clue: if crypto is the only loud signal, it becomes the main risk barometer.

- I treated the quiet calendar as a risk factor, not a relief.
- Crypto signals mattered more than usual this week.

## Rates & Liquidity
Rates did not dominate, which is unusual for this regime. That is not necessarily bullish. It just means there wasn’t a new rate shock to reprice.

In this environment, liquidity cues come more from positioning and cross-asset signals than from data prints. I kept my risk posture neutral.

- Rates were quiet, but that did not equal bullish.
- Liquidity cues came from positioning, not data.

## Equities
The equity tape lacked a strong narrative. That is often when dispersion increases because the market trades idiosyncratic stories. I did not see a broad theme, which kept me cautious.

I treat low-catalyst weeks as a time to reduce assumptions. If there is no catalyst, the market can still move, but it can also reverse quickly when a catalyst appears.

- Equity narratives were muted.
- Dispersion risk stayed elevated.

## Commodities & FX
I didn’t see a dominant commodity or FX narrative this week. That also reinforces the “quiet calendar” theme. The absence of a strong macro signal makes me more sensitive to any sudden policy headline.

- Commodities and FX were not leading signals.
- I stayed alert for sudden policy shocks.

## Crypto Macro
Crypto was the loudest signal. BTC dominance remained high, ETH looked like it was trying to find support, and SOL/BTC was framed as an emotional trade. That is exactly the kind of setup where I prioritize risk management.

I stayed anchored to the idea that dominance in the mid-60s is a warning against aggressive alt exposure. Until dominance softens, I assume liquidity is still concentrated.

- BTC dominance remained the risk budget.
- ETH and SOL/BTC signals suggested fragile sentiment.

## Positioning & Flow
Flow felt tactical. I did not see conviction buying. That aligns with the quiet macro calendar and the lack of a clean equity narrative.

I kept sizes smaller and focused on liquidity cues. If the next catalyst arrives, I want flexibility.

- Flow stayed tactical.
- I prioritized flexibility over conviction.

## Outlook Next Week
Next week is about the next impulse. If the macro calendar heats up, the market can break out of this range. If not, I expect more tactical positioning and short-lived moves.

I will keep tracking BTC dominance and ETH positioning as the lead signals until a clearer macro narrative appears.

- Main risk: a sudden macro shock in a thin tape.
- Main opportunity: a clean catalyst that breaks the range.

policy 30% / inflation 25% / liquidity 25% / growth 20%.
### Data Quality
Data quality: moderate — hard data is present, but the narrative is still noisy.
### Counter-thesis
This view breaks if breadth improves and policy risk fades enough to sustain risk-on flows.
