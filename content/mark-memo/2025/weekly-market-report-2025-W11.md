# Weekly Market Report 2025-W11

This week was about seasonality, policy headlines, and a sense that the market was leaning into short-term caution. I read it as a transition week: the macro calendar was still light, but the policy narrative started to thicken again. That combination usually creates hesitation rather than conviction.

I kept cross-checking with [[weekly-market-report-2025-W10]] because the “quiet tape” theme carried forward, but I felt the tone shift. More tariff chatter and more talk about “crashing” markets told me the risk premium was ticking up. That does not automatically mean bearish, but it does mean the bid is fragile.

On the crypto side, the key signal was BTC slipping below the bull market support band. That matters because it changes how I read risk appetite. When BTC loses its support band, I assume liquidity is fragile and I keep exposure tight.

## Overall Summary
This week felt like a seasonality check. I saw a mix of cautionary macro commentary and policy noise that kept the tape reactive. It was not a decisive risk-on or risk-off week; it was a week of hesitancy.

BTC under the bull market support band was the cleanest structural signal. It did not confirm a full breakdown, but it did confirm that liquidity is not as strong as it looked in earlier weeks.

- Seasonality narratives stayed loud, but conviction stayed thin.
- Policy headlines raised the risk premium.
- BTC fell below the bull market support band, signaling fragile liquidity.

## Regime Call
Regime: risk-off — policy risk elevated; inflation path uncertain.

## Quant Anchors
- 250310M — referenced this week.
- 3% — referenced this week.

## Signals I'm Watching
- Main risk: policy headlines destabilize a thin tape.
- Main opportunity: BTC stabilizes and seasonality turns supportive.

## Positioning Snapshot
I stayed defensive, kept size smaller, and prioritized capital preservation.

## Commentary
I treated this as a “wait for impulse” week. The market felt like it was searching for a catalyst rather than reacting to one. That keeps me cautious, because the first catalyst that arrives tends to carry more weight in a thin tape.

The market commentary I reviewed leaned toward caution, including views that short beta was the safer posture. I did not take that as a full signal, but I did respect the tone: when people start talking about hedging, the bid is not deep.

- I reduced assumptions because the tape felt indecisive.
- The risk premium rose with policy noise.

## Rates & Liquidity
Rates were not the dominant story this week, but liquidity still felt thin. When the calendar is quiet, liquidity often becomes a positioning story rather than a data story. That is exactly how this week felt.

I stayed focused on the idea that any new policy headline could reprice risk quickly. That is the fragility of a low-catalyst week.

- Rates stayed quiet, but liquidity did not feel deep.
- Policy headlines remained the swing factor.

## Equities
Equities lacked a clean narrative. I saw a mix of seasonality commentary and market caution, which often leads to choppy action. That is not a tape where I want to be aggressive.

The broader lesson is that when the market lacks a clear narrative, it defaults to technical and sentiment signals. That favors patience over conviction.

- Equity leadership was unclear.
- I stayed tactical due to mixed signals.

## Commodities & FX
I did not see a dominant commodity or FX trend. That reinforces the idea that this was a “searching” week. The absence of a macro driver makes me more sensitive to sudden policy shocks.

- Commodities and FX were not leading signals.
- I stayed alert for any policy surprise.

## Crypto Macro
BTC slipping below the bull market support band was the key signal. That is a structural warning. It does not mean immediate downside, but it does mean risk appetite is more fragile than it looked earlier.

ETH was framed as “almost home,” which suggests a potential stabilization, but I still need BTC to reassert its base before I increase risk.

- BTC below the support band kept me defensive.
- ETH stabilization was tentative, not confirmed.

## Positioning & Flow
Flows felt tactical again. I did not see strong accumulation. This aligns with the broader seasonality hesitation.

When conviction is low, I want to keep optionality. That was my posture this week.

- Positioning was tactical, not conviction.
- I stayed flexible to respond to a sudden catalyst.

## Outlook Next Week
Next week is about whether the market finds a catalyst or continues to drift. If BTC reclaims its support band and equities find a stronger narrative, the tape can stabilize. If not, I expect continued choppiness.

- Main risk: policy headlines destabilize a thin tape.
- Main opportunity: BTC stabilizes and seasonality turns supportive.

policy 30% / inflation 25% / liquidity 25% / growth 20%.
### Data Quality
Data quality: moderate — hard data is present, but the narrative is still noisy.
### Counter-thesis
This view breaks if breadth improves and policy risk fades enough to sustain risk-on flows.
