# Weekly Market Report 2025-W12

This week was about pre-FOMC positioning and a subtle shift in liquidity expectations. The market wasn’t loud, but it was tense. I read the week as a “hold your breath” phase: positioning was tactical, and the real catalyst was still ahead.

I kept cross-checking with [[weekly-market-report-2025-W11]] because the seasonality theme continued, but this week carried a clearer macro anchor: the Fed slowing quantitative tightening. That kind of shift doesn’t flip the market overnight, but it changes the liquidity mood, and I felt that in the tape.

Crypto signals were also front and center. The bull market support band, RSI framing, and pre-FOMC caution all told me liquidity was still in charge. I treated that as a reminder to stay humble about any short-term move.

## Overall Summary
This was a cautious, pre-FOMC week with a slight improvement in liquidity expectations. The market didn’t break out, but it didn’t collapse either. That is usually the posture ahead of a policy catalyst.

I saw the week as a positioning week. The focus was on how to survive the next macro impulse, not on chasing the current one.

The other subtle signal was how often the week framed “structure” instead of “direction.” That tells me participants were more focused on where support might hold than on where a new trend would begin. When traders start talking about bands, RSI, and pre-event setups, they are not committing; they are waiting.

- Pre-FOMC caution kept flows tactical.
- QT slowdown talk improved the liquidity mood.
- Crypto support-band signals stayed in focus.

## Regime Call
Regime: transitional — policy risk elevated; inflation path uncertain.

## Quant Anchors
- 250317M — referenced this week.

## Signals I'm Watching
- Main risk: the catalyst surprises the market.
- Main opportunity: policy clarity stabilizes liquidity.

## Positioning Snapshot
I stayed tactical, focused on reaction over prediction, and kept flexibility high.

## Commentary
I treated this as a “pre-catalyst” tape. When the macro event is ahead, traders compress risk. That’s what I saw here. The week was about positioning, not conviction.

The QT slowdown narrative mattered because it shifts the liquidity base. It does not guarantee an uptrend, but it reduces the tail risk of sudden tightening. That allowed some risk appetite to remain, even if it was cautious.

I also noticed the tone shift toward “cycle framing” rather than “headline chasing.” That usually happens in waiting weeks. It keeps me focused on process: where is the risk, what is the catalyst, and how much time do I have before the next repricing.

- I stayed tactical ahead of the policy catalyst.
- Liquidity expectations improved slightly, but not enough to declare a trend.

## Rates & Liquidity
The Fed’s QT slowdown message was the key. It is a softer liquidity signal that reduces pressure on risk assets, but it doesn’t equal easing. That distinction matters.

I treated the week as a liquidity reset rather than a new cycle. The market still needs confirmation from data and policy.

If the QT slowdown message is confirmed, the next test is whether real risk appetite shows up in breadth. That is the confirmation that turns a waiting tape into a trend tape. I did not see that yet.

- QT slowdown talk softened the liquidity backdrop.
- Rates stayed in wait-and-see mode.

## Equities
Equities stayed range-bound. Without a strong catalyst, the tape remains choppy. I did not see a strong breadth signal, which kept me cautious.

I also watched for value ideas as a counterbalance, but I didn’t see a rotation strong enough to change the overall posture.

That tells me the market is still positioned for caution. A range-bound tape with light participation is not a great environment to press exposure. It is a better environment to wait and react.

- Equity narrative remained muted.
- I did not see broad participation.

## Commodities & FX
Commodities and FX were not leading. That fit the “pre-catalyst” theme. When the macro event is ahead, cross-asset markets often go quiet.

- Commodity and FX signals were secondary.
- I stayed focused on the policy catalyst.

## Crypto Macro
Crypto was the clearest signal. The bull market support band, RSI framing, and pre-FOMC caution all pointed to a market waiting for direction. I treated it as a risk barometer rather than a trade signal.

- BTC support-band signals stayed central.
- RSI framing reinforced a cautious posture.

## Positioning & Flow
Flows were tactical. This is what I expect in a pre-FOMC week. When the policy catalyst is near, risk appetite compresses.

I stayed flexible and avoided heavy commitments. The next week is likely to set the tone.

- Positioning stayed tactical.
- Flexibility mattered more than conviction.

## Outlook Next Week
Next week is about the policy catalyst. If the Fed confirms a softer liquidity path, the tape can stabilize. If not, the market can reprice quickly.

- Main risk: the catalyst surprises the market.
- Main opportunity: policy clarity stabilizes liquidity.

policy 38% / inflation 31% / liquidity 31%.
### Data Quality
Data quality: moderate — hard data is present, but the narrative is still noisy.
### Counter-thesis
This view breaks if either policy risk spikes or breadth improves materially.
