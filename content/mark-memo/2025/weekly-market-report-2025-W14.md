# Weekly Market Report 2025-W14

This week was dominated by tariff shock and a sudden macro-driven selloff. The narrative shifted quickly from “fragile but stable” to “fragile and breaking.” I treated this as a policy-led week where the macro headlines overpowered the technical signals.

I kept cross-checking with [[weekly-market-report-2025-W13]] because the fragile sentiment from last week became the fuel for this week’s selloff. When the tape is already delicate, policy shocks carry more weight. That is exactly what happened here.

The S&P 500 narrative turned into a “what is happening” moment. I did not see a clean bottom this week. I saw a tape that was still repricing policy risk.

## Overall Summary
This was a policy shock week. Tariff headlines did the heavy lifting and pushed risk lower. The market reacted like it was repricing a new risk premium.

Crypto commentary remained cautious, but equities were the main story. The tape was not reacting to data; it was reacting to policy. That is a different regime.

I treated the shift as structural rather than temporary. When policy dominates, you can’t rely on mean reversion. You have to assume the market’s risk budget just got smaller.

- Tariff shock dominated the tape.
- Equity weakness reflected a policy-driven risk premium.
- Crypto remained cautious but did not lead the narrative.

## Regime Call
Regime: risk-off — policy risk elevated; inflation path uncertain.

## Quant Anchors
- 250331M — referenced this week.
- 2% — referenced this week.
- 18 m — referenced this week.
- 20% — referenced this week.

## Signals I'm Watching
- Main risk: policy shock deepens into broader risk-off.
- Main opportunity: policy noise fades and liquidity returns.

## Positioning Snapshot
I stayed defensive, kept size smaller, and prioritized capital preservation.

## Commentary
I treated this as a macro-driven selloff rather than a technical correction. The policy narrative was loud enough to change behavior. That makes it harder to trust quick rebounds.

I kept positioning light because the market was repricing risk, not just digesting a data point. In that environment, patience matters.

I also watched for the kind of forced selling that tends to follow policy shocks. The tape felt vulnerable to it, which is another reason I stayed defensive.

- I reduced exposure in response to policy shock.
- The tape felt like it was repricing risk, not just correcting.

## Rates & Liquidity
Rates were secondary to policy this week. Liquidity tightened because risk appetite pulled back. That is a different dynamic than a rate-driven selloff.

I treated liquidity as fragile. If the policy narrative continues, liquidity can tighten further.

I also watched for any sign that liquidity stress was spreading beyond equities. I did not see a systemic signal yet, but the sensitivity was high enough to keep me defensive.

- Liquidity tightened on policy shock.
- Rates were not the primary driver.

## Equities
Equities were the focal point. The market narrative was “what is happening,” and that usually means a risk reset. I did not see stable leadership or breadth.

I treat those weeks as structural: the market is not just reacting, it is recalibrating.

When the market is recalibrating, it often needs more time than we want to give it. That is why I did not look for a quick bottom.

The other signal was how quickly sentiment shifted from “wait and see” to “protect capital.” That is a behavioral change, not just a price change. I respect it until proven otherwise.

- Equity weakness was policy-led.
- Breadth and leadership were unstable.

## Commodities & FX
Commodities and FX moved with policy headlines. I did not read them as leading signals; they were reactive to the macro shock.

- Commodities and FX followed the policy narrative.
- I used them as confirmation, not catalysts.

## Crypto Macro
Crypto stayed cautious. The broader risk tone kept crypto in a defensive posture, which matches the macro regime shift.

- Crypto remained defensive.
- Liquidity stayed the key driver.

## Positioning & Flow
Flows were defensive. I saw risk reduction rather than opportunistic buying. That is typical in policy shock weeks.

The absence of dip-buying was another confirmation. When dip buying disappears, the market is admitting that policy risk is larger than usual.

- Positioning shifted defensive.
- I avoided chasing any bounce.

## Outlook Next Week
Next week is about whether policy shock fades or escalates. If it fades, the tape can stabilize. If it escalates, the risk premium widens.

I will be watching for any sign that policy rhetoric becomes policy action. That’s the difference between volatility and a longer drawdown.

- Main risk: policy shock deepens into broader risk-off.
- Main opportunity: policy noise fades and liquidity returns.

policy 30% / inflation 25% / liquidity 25% / growth 20%.
### Data Quality
Data quality: mixed — sentiment and positioning lead, hard data still mixed.
### Counter-thesis
This view breaks if breadth improves and policy risk fades enough to sustain risk-on flows.
