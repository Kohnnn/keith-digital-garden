# Weekly Market Report 2025-W15

This week was about tariff shock, a sharp drawdown, and a policy pause that tried to stabilize the tape. The S&P 500 dropping 20% is not just a headline; it is a regime marker. Once you hit that level, the market shifts from “dip buying” to “risk control.” I treated it as a regime week.

The 90-day tariff pause was the counterweight. It was a signal that policymakers were aware of market stress. It did not erase the drawdown, but it slowed the momentum. That is why the tape felt less chaotic by week’s end.

Inflation data also shifted the conversation. A 2.4% inflation print is meaningful because it suggests cooling in the macro backdrop, even as policy risk stayed loud. The market had to hold both ideas at once: policy shock and disinflation.

## Overall Summary
This was a policy shock week with a stabilizing response. The 20% drawdown framed the risk reset, while the 90-day pause offered a temporary relief valve.

The key message for me was that policy risk can overpower macro data in the short run. Even with inflation easing, the tape can stay fragile if trade policy remains uncertain.

I treated the 20% drawdown as a behavioral marker. It changes investor reflexes. People stop buying dips and start managing exposure. That shift is why the same headline hits harder in drawdown regimes than in trend regimes.

- The S&P 500 dropped 20%, marking a regime shift.
- A 90-day tariff pause helped stabilize sentiment.
- Inflation cooled to 2.4%, but policy risk stayed dominant.

## Regime Call
Regime: risk-off — policy risk elevated; inflation path uncertain.

## Quant Anchors
- 250407M — referenced this week.
- 20% — referenced this week.
- 2.4% — referenced this week.
- 0.2% — referenced this week.
- $2.5 — referenced this week.

## Signals I'm Watching
- Main risk: tariffs re-escalate after the pause.
- Main opportunity: policy clarity allows stabilization.

## Positioning Snapshot
I stayed defensive, kept size smaller, and prioritized capital preservation.

## Commentary
I kept cross-checking with [[weekly-market-report-2025-W14]] because last week’s tariff shock carried straight into this week’s drawdown. The difference was the policy response. A pause is not a reversal, but it changes the pace of risk-off.

I treated the 20% drop as a signal to reduce assumptions. In drawdown regimes, price action becomes more about risk control than about narrative. That means patience and discipline matter more than forecasts.

I also watched for any sign that the pause would become a longer policy shift. I did not see that yet, so I kept my risk posture conservative.

- I stayed defensive because drawdowns can widen quickly.
- The pause helped sentiment, but it did not erase the policy risk.

## Rates & Liquidity
Rates were not the main driver; policy was. That is why the pause mattered: it did more to stabilize liquidity than any single data print.

Still, the inflation print at 2.4% is meaningful. It reduces the odds of a policy mistake, even if it does not remove the tariff risk.

If inflation continues to cool, it can shorten the duration of the drawdown. But if tariffs re-escalate, the inflation benefit may not be enough. That’s the tension I am watching.

- Policy response stabilized liquidity.
- 2.4% inflation improved the macro backdrop at the margin.

## Equities
Equities were in risk control mode. The 20% drawdown changed behavior. Investors were not looking for upside; they were managing downside.

I watched for stabilization signs, but I did not see enough to declare a bottom. The pause helped, but the tape still needs time to digest.

In these regimes I want to see breadth, volume, and a reduction in gap risk. I did not see that this week, which is why I stayed cautious.

- Equity behavior shifted to risk control.
- Stabilization was tentative, not confirmed.

## Commodities & FX
FX and commodities reacted to the policy story. The tariff pause helped calm volatility, but the drawdown still kept hedging demand elevated.

- Policy headlines drove FX and commodity reactions.
- Hedging demand stayed elevated.

## Crypto Macro
Crypto stayed tied to risk. When equities are in drawdown mode, crypto tends to follow the broader risk pulse rather than lead it.

I stayed cautious. A drawdown regime is not the environment for aggressive crypto rotation.

- Crypto moved with risk appetite.
- I kept a defensive posture.

## Positioning & Flow
Flows were defensive. The market was de-risking into the drawdown and only cautiously re-risking after the pause. That is typical of a regime shift week.

- Positioning stayed defensive.
- Re-risking was cautious and selective.

## Outlook Next Week
Next week is about whether the pause becomes durable policy or just a temporary patch. If policy risk fades, the market can stabilize. If policy risk re-escalates, the drawdown can deepen.

- Main risk: tariffs re-escalate after the pause.
- Main opportunity: policy clarity allows stabilization.

policy 30% / inflation 25% / liquidity 25% / growth 20%.
### Data Quality
Data quality: moderate — hard data is present, but the narrative is still noisy.
### Counter-thesis
This view breaks if breadth improves and policy risk fades enough to sustain risk-on flows.
