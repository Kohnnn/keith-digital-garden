# Weekly Market Report 2025-W16

This week felt like a continuation of the post-drawdown regime. The tape was still fragile, and the policy narrative stayed in the driver’s seat. The trade war rhetoric escalated, and the market tone was caught between a relief bounce and a reminder that policy risk has not disappeared.

I kept cross-checking with [[weekly-market-report-2025-W15]] because the 20% drawdown regime didn’t resolve; it just stabilized. The difference this week was the emphasis on “Trump vs Powell” and the reminder that the next policy headline can still overwhelm any technical bounce.

The equity tape felt like a “date with destiny” setup: the market knows it must choose between stabilizing into a new base or breaking lower if policy noise intensifies. I treated that as a fragile balance rather than a confident uptrend.

## Overall Summary
This was a policy-led week. The trade war narrative worsened, and the market’s resilience felt conditional. I didn’t see the kind of breadth or liquidity that would turn a post-drawdown rally into a new trend.

The best summary of the week is that it was not a reset; it was a pause. The market is still trying to figure out whether policy risk is fading or merely regrouping.

- Trade war rhetoric escalated and kept the risk premium elevated.
- The tape felt fragile despite attempts to stabilize.
- The market looked like it was searching for a new base, not declaring a new trend.

## Regime Call
Regime: risk-off — policy risk elevated; breadth still thin.

## Quant Anchors
- 250414M — referenced this week.
- 20% — referenced this week.
- $35 — referenced this week.
- 5.2% — referenced this week.
- 5% — referenced this week.

## Signals I'm Watching
- Main risk: policy rhetoric escalates into a renewed selloff.
- Main opportunity: policy noise fades and liquidity stabilizes.

## Positioning Snapshot
I stayed defensive, kept size smaller, and prioritized capital preservation.

## Commentary
I treated the week as a continuation of the drawdown regime. That means I stayed defensive and waited for evidence rather than chasing early strength. I did not see confirmation that policy risk was fading.

The “Trump vs Powell” framing reinforced my caution. When policy becomes a direct market narrative, it increases the odds of sudden repricing. That makes short-term rallies less trustworthy.

- I stayed cautious because policy risk remains the dominant variable.
- The market’s stability felt conditional on headline flow.

## Rates & Liquidity
Rates were not the loudest story, but liquidity still felt thin. In a post-drawdown regime, liquidity is fragile until proven otherwise. I treated it that way.

The absence of a strong rate narrative did not make me more confident. It simply meant the market’s next move would likely be policy-driven rather than data-driven.

- Liquidity felt thin despite quieter rate headlines.
- Policy risk remained the primary driver of risk appetite.

## Equities
Equities were in a fragile stabilization phase. The market didn’t show a clean reversal or a clean breakdown. That is the most difficult environment to trade because the risk-reward is unclear.

I watched for broad participation and did not see it. I saw selective strength, which is not enough to declare a trend in this regime.

- Equity strength stayed selective.
- I did not see convincing breadth or volume confirmation.

## Commodities & FX
The commodity and FX markets mirrored the policy narrative. They were reactive rather than leading. That confirms the market is still policy-driven.

- Commodities and FX followed policy headlines.
- I treated them as confirmation, not catalysts.

## Crypto Macro
BTC dominance continued to climb, which keeps me in a BTC-first posture. The “dominance train” framing is consistent with a market that is still cautious and liquidity-constrained.

The bull market support band remained the key structural signal for me. If BTC stays under pressure, it reinforces my defensive posture across risk assets.

- BTC dominance stayed strong, keeping the market concentrated.
- The support band remains my key risk boundary.

## Positioning & Flow
Flows stayed tactical. I did not see broad accumulation. That keeps me cautious about the durability of any rally.

- Positioning stayed defensive.
- I kept risk small while the tape searched for a base.

## Outlook Next Week
Next week is about whether policy risk fades or intensifies. If the trade war narrative cools and the market finds a base, we can stabilize. If not, the drawdown regime continues.

- Main risk: policy rhetoric escalates into a renewed selloff.
- Main opportunity: policy noise fades and liquidity stabilizes.

policy 40% / liquidity 33% / growth 27%.
### Data Quality
Data quality: mixed — sentiment and positioning lead, hard data still mixed.
### Counter-thesis
This view breaks if breadth improves and policy risk fades enough to sustain risk-on flows.
