# Weekly Market Report 2025-W20

This week had a clearer risk‑on impulse. A China tariff‑deal headline and CPI cooling to 2.3% pushed the tape higher and tested whether the market could transition from fragile stabilization into a more confident bid. I treated it as a test, not a conclusion.

I kept cross‑checking with [[weekly-market-report-2025-W19]] because last week’s dominance signal still mattered. The difference this week was that the narrative provided a clearer catalyst. The question for me was simple: is this a one‑off relief move, or the start of broader participation?

Crypto breadth metrics also came into focus. If the rally is real, I expect crypto breadth to expand, not just BTC dominance to persist. That’s the tell I’m watching.

## Overall Summary
This was a catalyst week. Inflation cooled to 2.3%, and the China tariff‑deal narrative sparked a risk‑on reaction. The tape responded positively, but the structure still needs confirmation.

The key takeaway is that the market finally had a clear macro input that reduced risk premium. Whether that shift holds depends on breadth and liquidity follow‑through.

I also noticed how quickly the tone shifted from defense to optimism. That is a good sign, but it can also be a trap if breadth does not confirm. I treated the early enthusiasm as a signal to watch, not a reason to chase.

- CPI cooled to 2.3%, easing the inflation overhang.
- China tariff‑deal headlines lifted risk appetite.
- The week was a test of whether liquidity can broaden.

## Regime Call
Regime: risk-on — policy risk elevated; inflation path uncertain.

## Quant Anchors
- 250512M — referenced this week.
- 2.3% — referenced this week.
- 3% — referenced this week.
- 2025 M — referenced this week.

## Signals I'm Watching
- Main risk: catalyst fades and liquidity narrows again.
- Main opportunity: breadth expands and the trend stabilizes.

## Positioning Snapshot
I stayed tactical, focused on reaction over prediction, and kept flexibility high.

## Commentary
I treated the week as a deliberate test. The macro data gave the market permission to rally, but permission is not confirmation. I want to see breadth, volume, and persistence before I declare a regime shift.

I also watched the crypto breadth framing. If the rally is truly broad, it should show up in broader crypto participation, not just a single‑asset move.

That is why I kept my posture neutral‑to‑cautious even after the CPI relief. I want to see whether the market can hold gains without constant headline support.

- I respected the catalyst but waited for confirmation.
- Breadth is the line between relief and trend.

## Rates & Liquidity
CPI at 2.3% is a meaningful release. It reduces the inflation pressure that has dominated the tape. That should help liquidity, but only if the market trusts it.

I also watched yields for confirmation. A softer CPI should translate into calmer rate expectations. If yields do not respond, it tells me the market does not believe the disinflation story yet.

- Softer inflation improved the liquidity backdrop.
- I still need confirmation in yields and breadth.

## Equities
Equities rallied on the tariff‑deal narrative, but I treated it as a test of participation. A trade‑deal headline can ignite a rally, but a rally only becomes a trend if the participation widens.

I was looking for dispersion to narrow and for leaders to broaden. I did not see enough to declare a new trend, but I did see enough to stay attentive.

- The equity move looked catalyst‑driven.
- Breadth will determine whether it sticks.

## Commodities & FX
FX and commodities reacted to the inflation and tariff news. That is consistent with a catalyst week. I watched for confirmation that the macro relief was real, not just a headline spike.

- Cross‑asset response aligned with the catalyst.
- I still want confirmation beyond the initial reaction.

## Crypto Macro
Crypto breadth and dominance were the key. If CPI relief and trade‑deal optimism are real, I expect broader participation. If dominance stays high, the move may still be narrow.

- Crypto breadth is the confirmation signal I need.
- Dominance staying high would keep me cautious.

## Positioning & Flow
Flows looked more optimistic, but I still treated them as tactical. A catalyst week can create fast flows without creating a new trend. I want to see continuity.

- Flow improved but still felt tactical.
- I stayed cautious until breadth confirms.

## Outlook Next Week
Next week is about whether the rally holds. If CPI relief and tariff‑deal optimism persist, the market can broaden. If the narrative fades, the rally will look like a brief squeeze.

- Main risk: catalyst fades and liquidity narrows again.
- Main opportunity: breadth expands and the trend stabilizes.

policy 30% / inflation 25% / liquidity 25% / growth 20%.
### Data Quality
Data quality: moderate — hard data is present, but the narrative is still noisy.
### Counter-thesis
This view breaks if rates reprice higher or breadth narrows again.
