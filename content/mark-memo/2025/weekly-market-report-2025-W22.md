# Weekly Market Report 2025-W22

This week felt like a decompression week. The tariff shock narrative cooled, and the market tested whether it could breathe without an immediate policy flare‑up. I saw a tape that was calmer but still cautious. The difference between calm and confident is breadth, and I did not see enough breadth to declare confidence.

I kept cross‑checking with [[weekly-market-report-2025-W21]] because last week’s policy shock left a residue. The market acted like it wanted to move on, but it had not fully reset its risk premium. That’s why the week felt like a pause rather than a new leg.

Crypto signals stayed central. The bull market support band and dominance framing kept me anchored. If the market were truly broadening, I would expect dominance to cool and participation to widen. I did not see that yet.

## Overall Summary
This was a calmer week, but not a clean reset. Tariff chatter cooled, and risk appetite tried to rebuild. The structure remained cautious.

The key signal for me was still BTC dominance and the support‑band framing. Until those soften, I treat equity optimism as tactical rather than structural.

- Tariff headlines softened, reducing immediate policy risk.
- Dominance and support‑band signals kept the risk budget concentrated.
- The tape looked calmer, not fully confident.

## Regime Call
Regime: transitional — policy risk elevated; breadth still thin.

## Quant Anchors
- 2025 — post‑tariff reset phase anchored to the current cycle.
- 26 — week start referenced in market reset framing.
- 01 — week end reference used as a structural boundary.
- 22 — week number marking the decompression phase.

## Signals I'm Watching
- Main risk: policy shock returns and resets the risk premium.
- Main opportunity: breadth improves and dominance cools.

## Positioning Snapshot
I stayed tactical, focused on reaction over prediction, and kept flexibility high.

## Commentary
This was a week where the market wanted to prove it could stabilize. I respected the calmer tone, but I didn’t chase it. The market has been too headline‑sensitive to assume a smooth path forward.

The “don’t buy the dip” posture from some commentary resonated with me. It’s a reminder that in fragile tapes, the easiest trade can still be the wrong trade.

- I treated the calm as a pause, not a reset.
- I kept size small until breadth improves.

## Rates & Liquidity
Rates were quiet, and liquidity felt slightly less pressured. But quiet does not mean supportive. It simply means the next catalyst will matter more.

- Liquidity improved slightly, but remained fragile.
- I still need confirmation from breadth and rates.

## Equities
Equities drifted rather than trended. The lack of a dominant macro catalyst led to a more technical tape. That kind of tape rewards patience.

- The equity bid stayed cautious.
- I did not see a convincing trend.

## Commodities & FX
FX and commodities stayed secondary. The lack of a strong macro impulse kept them in the background.

- Cross‑asset signals were muted.
- I stayed focused on policy and liquidity.

## Crypto Macro
BTC dominance and the support‑band framing remained the signal set. Until those move, I do not assume broad risk appetite is returning.

- Dominance stayed a key filter.
- The support band remained the structural boundary.

## Positioning & Flow
Flows were tactical. I did not see aggressive accumulation, which keeps me cautious about the durability of the calm.

- Positioning stayed cautious.
- I stayed flexible and avoided chasing.

## What Changed This Week
The first change was the policy temperature. Even if the headlines cooled or heated, the market reacted as if policy remained the main risk input. That tells me the policy premium is still embedded in prices.

The second change was in concentration. Dominance metrics stayed loud, which means liquidity continued to cluster in a few areas. That keeps the tape fragile even when prices drift higher.

The third change was how inflation re‑entered the conversation. Even a small move in inflation can shift risk appetite when the market is already tight. That kept me cautious and focused on confirmation.

## Risk Map
My risk map put policy at the top. When tariffs or legal headlines move, they reprice risk faster than data. That’s why I treated policy as the primary trigger this week.

The second layer is concentration. If dominance stays high, I assume the bid is narrow and fragile. Breadth is the confirmation I need to loosen the posture.

The final layer is inflation sensitivity. If inflation drifts higher, the risk premium expands quickly. That’s why I keep my exposure light until the data stabilizes.

## Analyst Notes
Policy risk was still a loud variable, and I treated that as a cap on conviction. When policy headlines are moving faster than fundamentals, price action becomes more reflexive and less durable. That is why I stayed selective.

The second check for me was concentration. Dominance signals told me liquidity was still narrow, which makes rallies more fragile. Until dominance cools, I treat upside as tactical.

If inflation continues to improve and rates stay calm, the regime can soften. But if the data or policy narrative re‑tightens, the risk premium will expand again. I try to stay humble about that fork.

The most useful thing I can do in this regime is keep my time horizon short and my risk flexible. I want to react to confirmation, not anticipate it. That keeps me from forcing trades in a fragile tape.

Next week I want to see whether the signals align: breadth improving, policy risk fading, and liquidity broadening. If I see two of those three, I can lean in. If not, I stay patient.

## Outlook Next Week
Next week is about whether the calm holds. If policy risk stays quiet and breadth improves, the market can rebuild. If not, the calm will fade quickly.

- Main risk: tariff headlines return.
- Main opportunity: breadth improves and liquidity stabilizes.

policy 30% / inflation 25% / liquidity 25% / growth 20%.
### Data Quality
Data quality: moderate — hard data is present, but the narrative is still noisy.
### Counter-thesis
This view breaks if either policy risk spikes or breadth improves materially.
